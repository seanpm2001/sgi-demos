<H1><A NAME="about.html"></A>About This Book</H1>
<P><A NAME="A3C0DE27001mhay"></A><I>GL3.2 Version 4 for AIX: Programming Concepts</I> provides information on the 
Graphics Library (GL). GL is an application programming interface (API) for performing 
advanced 3-D rendering, window management, and input device support. This book serves as 
both a tutorial and a guide; it is a programmer's source book for learning about 3-D 
graphics from a programmer's perspective.</P>



<H3><A NAME="A157C11209"></A>Who Should Use This Book</H3>
<P><A NAME="A3C0DE27023mhay"></A>This book is intended for programmers with C programming knowledge who want to develop 3-D applications. You should be acquainted with the C programming language enough to be able to write, compile, and link a program that prints <SAMP>Hello,&nbsp;World! </SAMP>on the screen. This book does not assume knowledge of computer graphics as a prerequisite.</P>

<H3><A NAME="C519672796vbia"></A>Before You Begin</H3>
<P><A NAME="A3C0DE27045mhay"></A>Having a basic understanding of the concepts of computer graphics makes this book easier to understand. An introduction to computer graphics can be found in one of the following books:</P>

<H3><A NAME="A157C1120f"></A>How to Use This Book </H3>
<P><A NAME="A3C0DE27069mhay"></A>In general, each chapter begins with basic information and progresses to more advanced topics. On first reading, advanced topics can be skipped.</P>

<H4><A NAME="A157C11211"></A>Overview of Contents</H4>
<P><A NAME="A3C0DE27089mhay"></A>This book contains the following chapters and appendixes:</P>

<UL><LI><A NAME="A157C11212"></A>Chapter 1, "AIX Graphics Library Overview," describes the AIX Graphics Library (GL) structure and function. It includes hardware and software prerequisites for running GL applications in addition to information on choosing the right GL subroutine.</LI>

<LI><A NAME="A157C11213"></A>Chapter 2, "Getting Started in GL," introduces GL functions with a series of programs.</LI>

<LI><A NAME="A157C11215"></A>Chapter 3, "Drawing with the Graphics Library," describes the GL drawing subroutines, including begin-end style, move-draw style, high-level, text, wire-frame, and NURBS curve subroutines. It also discusses such drawing operations as transferring pixel blocks, antialiasing, and setting pipeline options and drawing attributes. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="A157C11216"></A>Chapter 4, "Working with Coordinate Systems," discusses the coordinate transformations necessary to manipulate geometric figures and viewpoints in 3-D space.</LI>

<LI><A NAME="A157C11217"></A>Chapter 5, "Using Viewports and Screenmasks," describes the uses and implementation of viewports and screenmasks in a GL application.</LI>

<LI><A NAME="A157C11218"></A>Chapter 6, "Removing Hidden Surfaces," discusses GL use of a z-buffer.</LI>

<LI><A NAME="A157C11219"></A>Chapter 7, "Creating Lighting Effects," describes the GL lighting facility, used to specify light and material properties.</LI>

<LI><A NAME="A157C1121a"></A>Chapter 8, "Performing Depth-Cueing," discusses how to make an image appear three-dimensional by drawing those points brighter that are nearer to the viewer.</LI>

<LI><A NAME="A157C1121c"></A>Chapter 10, "Working with Objects (Display Lists)," discusses grouping a sequence of drawing subroutines as a single list to facilitate drawing identical figures. These graphical objects, or display lists, can be edited subsequently to create other figures.</LI>

<LI><A NAME="A157C1121d"></A>Chapter 11, "Picking and Selecting," describes two methods of obtaining three-dimensional input from a user.</LI>

<LI><A NAME="A157C1121e"></A>Chapter 12, "Understanding Windows and Input Control," discusses window management, cursors, keyboard input, queue and device control, system queries, pop-up menus, and textports.</LI>

<LI><A NAME="A157C1121f"></A>Chapter 13, "Using Enhanced X-Windows Calls with GL Subroutines," discusses how Enhanced X-Windows subroutines and GL subroutines can be used together.</LI>

<LI><A NAME="A157C11220"></A>Chapter 14, "Portability, Compatibility, and Performance," provides a list of enhancements included in this release (new or revised subroutines, new example programs, and new utilities), and discusses performance tuning.</LI>

<LI><A NAME="C519674228vbia"></A>Chapter 15, "System Programming Considerations,"  discusses special programming considerations applicable to multiple process management, linking and compiling using the GL shared library, linking FORTRAN and C modules; and lists unsupported or obsolete subroutines.</LI>
