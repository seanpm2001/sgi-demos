<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81210mhay"></A>Now that you are familiar with the basic
lighting capabilities of GL, the following sections discuss some of the
advanced lighting features. </P>

<A NAME="INDEX529"></A> </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81239mhay"></A>One property of surface materials is <I>emissivity</I>,
the amount of light radiated (not reflected) by the material itself. A
material can be made self-luminous by adding the identifier EMISSION to
the property list followed by the red, green, and blue emission components
(each with a value between 0.0 and 1.0). For example, we could define the
properties list for a material as the following: </P>


<PRE><A NAME="A342C971db"></A>float&nbsp;glowing_material[]&nbsp;=&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EMISSION,&nbsp;0.8,&nbsp;0.25,&nbsp;0.0,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AMBIENT,&nbsp;0.0,&nbsp;0.0,&nbsp;0.0,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIFFUSE,&nbsp;0.0,&nbsp;0.0,&nbsp;0.0,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPECULAR,&nbsp;0.0,&nbsp;0.0,&nbsp;0.0,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LMNULL};</PRE>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81262mhay"></A>The material would appear to emit orange
light. The ambient, diffuse, and specular reflectance values are specifically
assigned to 0.0 so the color of the object is not affected by light sources.
If the coefficients are not zeroed out, GL uses the default nonzero values.</P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81284mhay"></A>Using a material definition such as <TT>glowing_material</TT>
that has emissive but no reflective properties is useful for simulating
lights at night. It is important to distinguish between the way the lighting
facility handles surface materials with emissive properties and the way
it handles light emitted from light sources. Unlike a light source, emitted
light from a material does not affect the color of any other object. </P>


<H3><A NAME="A342C971e2"></A>More on Ambient Light<A NAME="INDEX530"></A>
<A NAME="INDEX531"></A> <A NAME="INDEX532"></A> <A NAME="INDEX533"></A>
<A NAME="INDEX534"></A> <A NAME="INDEX535"></A> </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81306mhay"></A>In defining the simple lighting calculation,
the default values for ambient light and ambient reflectance provided by
GL were used. However, GL allows you to control the amount of ambient light
displayed in the scene in three different ways: </P>


<UL><LI><A NAME="A168C1164"></A>Color</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A168C1165"></A>Additional, specific light source</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A168C1166"></A>Material reflectance values</LI></UL>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81330mhay"></A>You can specify the color of ambient light
present in the entire scene. Because the color of ambient light is the
same at any point in the scene, the scene ambient light color is a property
of the lighting model. For example, in defining a lighting calculation
with the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmdef.html#rgZ2250marj">lmdef</A></B>
subroutine using the property list, the lines </P>


<PRE><A NAME="A342C971e7"></A>float&nbsp;simple_light_model[]&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{AMBIENT,&nbsp;0.3,&nbsp;0.3,&nbsp;0.3,&nbsp;LMNULL};</PRE>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81352mhay"></A>define a lighting model similar to the
simple lighting calculation except that this example overrides the default
scene ambient light color with the specified values. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81373mhay"></A>In addition to the scene 
<A HREF="specialterms.html#A3C0F2A3015mhay">ambient light</A>
 color specified in the lighting model, a specific light
source can contribute to the ambient light in the scene. Consider the following
modification to the property array <TT>blue_light</TT>: </P>


<PRE><A NAME="A342C971eb"></A>float&nbsp;blue_light[]&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{LCOLOR,&nbsp;0.0,&nbsp;0.0,&nbsp;0.6,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AMBIENT,&nbsp;0.0,&nbsp;0.0,&nbsp;0.2,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POSITION,&nbsp;0.0,&nbsp;1.0,&nbsp;0.0,&nbsp;0.0,&nbsp;LMNULL};</PRE>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81395mhay"></A>Now, the ambient light associated with
<TT>blue_light</TT> is added to the scene ambient light once <TT>blue_light</TT>
has been defined and bound. Unlike the scene ambient light, the ambient
contribution from the blue light disappears if you turn the blue light
off. It is important to note that ambient light associated with a particular
light source is omnidirectional just like ambient light specified with
the lighting model. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81417mhay"></A>The third method of controlling displayed
ambient color is to alter the ambient light reflectance values of the material.
You have seen how to specify this property by using <TT><A HREF="advlightcap.html#A342C971db">glowing_material</A></TT>
(you set it to [0.0,&nbsp;0.0,&nbsp;0.0]). The ambient color displayed
for a surface is determined by adding the ambient contributions from the
light model and all of the light sources and multiplying the sum by the
material's ambient light reflectance values. </P>


<H3><A NAME="LuK21a0marj"></A>lmcolor Subroutine </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81439mhay"></A>You can also use the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmcolor.html#ofZ220marj">lmcolor</A></B>
subroutine to change the lighting components of an object while the program
is running. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81460mhay"></A>The <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmcolor.html#ofZ220marj">lmcolor</A></B>
subroutine lets you change the properties of the currently bound material.
It provides a high-performance path to the hardware that would not be otherwise
available. Normally, to change the properties of the currently bound material,
one would have to redefine the material with the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmdef.html#rgZ2250marj">lmdef</A></B>
subroutine and then rebind it with the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmbind.html#XeZ2340marj">lmbind</A></B>
subroutine. The <B>lmcolor</B> subroutine helps avoid some of the software
overhead involved in redefinitions and rebindings. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81481mhay"></A>The <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmcolor.html#ofZ220marj">lmcolor</A></B>
subroutine works by redirecting the target of the RGB mode color subroutines
(<B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/RGBcolor.html#A143X9394">RGBcolor</A></B>,
<B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/c.html#A143X9262">c</A></B>, and
<B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/cpack.html#A143X9284">cpack</A></B>).
Normally, these subroutines set the current color. If lighting is off,
the color subroutines can be made to affect material properties instead.
The syntax is as follows: </P>


<PRE><A NAME="A258C01bfcf"></A>void&nbsp;lmcolor(Int32&nbsp;mode)</PRE>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81503mhay"></A>This function accepts the following values
for mode: </P>


<TABLE><TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD NOWRAP="NOWRAP"><A NAME="A342C971f8"></A><B>LMC_COLOR</B> </TD>


<TD>RGB color commands set the current color. If a color is the last thing
sent before drawing a vertex, the vertex is drawn in that color; if a normal
is the last thing sent before drawing a vertex, the vertex is lighted (the
default mode).</TD></TR>


<TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD NOWRAP="NOWRAP"><A NAME="A342C971f9"></A><B>LMC_EMISSION</B> </TD>

<TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD NOWRAP="NOWRAP"><A NAME="A342C971fb"></A><B>LMC_DIFFUSE</B> </TD>


<TD>LRGB color commands set the diffuse color property of the currently

<TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD NOWRAP="NOWRAP"><A NAME="A342C971fc"></A><B>LMC_SPECULAR</B> </TD>


<TD>RGB color commands set the specular color property of the currently

<TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD NOWRAP="NOWRAP"><A NAME="A342C971fd"></A><B>LMC_AD</B> </TD>


<TD>RGB color commands set the diffuse and ambient color properties of

<TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD NOWRAP="NOWRAP"><A NAME="A342C971fe"></A><B>LMC_NULL</B> </TD>


<TD>RGB color commands are ignored.</TD></TR></TABLE>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81533mhay"></A>Calls to the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmdef.html#rgZ2250marj">lmdef</A></B>
subroutine can change properties of the currently bound material, but because
it must modify the data structure of the material, this subroutine executes
relatively slowly. The <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmcolor.html#ofZ220marj">lmcolor</A></B>
subroutine provides a fast and efficient way to change properties of the
currently bound material as maintained in the graphics hardware without
changing the definition of the material. This means, however, that all
<B>lmcolor</B> changes are lost when you bind a new material. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81555mhay"></A>Use the standard RGB-mode color subroutines
<B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/RGBcolor.html#A143X9394">RGBcolor</A></B>,
<B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/c.html#A143X9262">c</A></B>, and
<B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/cpack.html#A143X9284">cpack</A></B>
to change material properties selected by the <B>lmcolor</B> subroutine.
When lighting is not active, RGB-mode color commands change the current
drawing color. The <B>lmcolor</B> subroutine is significant only while
lighting is on. </P>

<A NAME="INDEX541"></A> </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81577mhay"></A>As stated in the section on <A HREF="lightbasics.html#A342C970eb">pecularity</A>,
the intensity and color of the specular highlight seen depends on the view
direction. The lighting calculations performed by the system take into
account the view direction, although they can do so in one of two different
ways. One of the methods, called <I>infinite viewer</I>, involves an approximation,
but results in significantly improved performance. The other method, <I>local
viewer</I>, is considerably slower, but more exact. For most applications,
there is very little difference in the visual appearance between the two
methods, and therefore the infinite viewer is the default. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81607mhay"></A>The infinite viewer makes the approximation
that the eye (as far as the lighting calculations are concerned) is infinitely
far away. This does not mean that the transformation matrices are somehow
altered; they are not. The geometry of the scene being drawn is completely
unaffected; only the colors that come out of the lighting equations are
affected. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81628mhay"></A>When this assumption is made, the view
direction vector remains constant throughout the scene. Using an infinite
viewer is beneficial to application performance because the system does
not have to recompute the view direction vector for every vertex in the
scene (recomputing this vector is computationally expensive because it
requires a square root operation). </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81649mhay"></A>However, describing the viewer as located
infinitely far away is not as realistic as placing the viewer at some finite
position. To define a local viewer, set the local viewer property in the
property list for the lighting model to true (1.0): </P>


<PRE><A NAME="A342C97206"></A>float&nbsp;local_viewer_model[]&nbsp;=&nbsp;{LOCALVIEWER,&nbsp;1.0,&nbsp;LMNULL};</PRE>


<BLOCKQUOTE><P><A NAME="A342C97208"></A><B>Note: </B>Because the local view vector
changes with each vertex, the lighting computation must be performed when
the vertex subroutine (<B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/v.html#A144X97a4">v3f</A></B>)
rather than the normal (<B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/n3f.html#A139X91ef3">n3f</A></B>
) subroutine is issued. When performing the lighting calculation at the
vertex, the graphics hardware uses the normal vector from the most recently
issued normal subroutine. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81673mhay"></A>The difference between infinite and local
viewer is significant only when the surface being drawn is extremely close
to the eye. For normal drawing, the performance improvement of the infinite
viewer should significantly outweigh the improved appearance of the local
viewer. </P>


<H3><A NAME="A342C97209"></A>Local Lights<A NAME="INDEX542"></A> <A NAME="INDEX543"></A>
<A NAME="INDEX544"></A> <A NAME="INDEX545"></A> <A NAME="INDEX546"></A>
<A NAME="INDEX547"></A> </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81695mhay"></A>Local lights are analogous to a local
viewer and are available through the lighting facility. To convert the
blue light from the earlier example to a local light, change the property
list definition to the following: </P>


<PRE><A NAME="A342C9720d"></A>float&nbsp;blue_light[]&nbsp;=&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LCOLOR,&nbsp;0.0,&nbsp;0.0,&nbsp;0.6,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POSITION,&nbsp;0.0,&nbsp;5.0,&nbsp;0.0,&nbsp;1.0,&nbsp;LMNULL};</PRE>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81718mhay"></A>Changing the fourth positional component
from a 0.0 to a 1.0 tells the system that this light is local and that
the <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, and <I>z</I> components specify a light position
rather than a light direction. This is a significant difference because
the light direction vector becomes the vector from the current vertex to
the position of the light. Thus, you must take care not to position the
light too close to the surface. If you are not careful, you may find that
you positioned the light source within or below a surface in your scene
(notice the <I>y</I> component of the position is changed from a 1.0 to
5.0 in the property list for <TT><A HREF="advlightcap.html#A342C9720d">blue_light</A></TT>).
Like a local viewer computation, the lighting computation is performed
when a vertex subroutine is issued when you are using a local light. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81739mhay"></A>Using a local viewer or local lights,
or both, makes a significant visual difference when you are displaying
geometry that contains flat surfaces. The normal vector across a flat surface
is constant. Thus, if you are using infinite light sources and an infinite
viewer, the angular relationships between the normal, view, and light vectors
remain constant, resulting in a constant color across the surface. Using
a local viewer or lights, or both, causes the view or light vectors, or
both, and the resultant color to change across the flat surface. (See the
example program <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/platelocal_c.html#sfM70marj">platelocal.c</A></B>
(in  in<I> GL3.2 Version 4 for AIX: Graphics Library (GL) Technical Reference</I> .) </P>


<H3><A NAME="A342C97288"></A>Light Attenuation<A NAME="INDEX548"></A> <A NAME="INDEX549"></A>
<A NAME="INDEX550"></A> <A NAME="INDEX551"></A> <A NAME="INDEX552"></A>
<A NAME="INDEX553"></A> </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81762mhay"></A>As you move a light further away from
an object, the effect of the light on the object diminishes. This is referred
to as light attenuation. If you are using local lights in your lighting
model, the lighting facility will attenuate them if desired. The amount
of attenuation is a function of the distance from the current vertex to
the light source. Because the attenuation function used is the same for
all local lights, the attenuation function is a property of the light model
rather than of a particular light. The attenuation 
function
used is as follows: </P>


<IMG SRC="figures/gl32p25.jpg">
<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81784mhay"></A>where Koff equals the constant scene attenuation
factor, fixed; Krate equals the scene attenuation rate; and Dist equals
the distance from current vertex to light source. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81805mhay"></A>The constant scene attenuation factor
sets the minimum attenuation that a light will undergo. It should be set
to a value greater than zero. The attenuation rate controls how fast the
attenuation sets in as a light is moved away. It should not be set to a
negative value. The resulting attenuation factor computed at a vertex is
clipped to [0.0, 1.0] and is multiplied with the light source color in
order to attenuate it. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81826mhay"></A>To specify attenuation in the light model
property list, specify the constant attenuation parameter followed by the
attenuation rate parameter: </P>


<PRE><A NAME="A342C97290"></A>float&nbsp;local_light_model[]&nbsp;=&nbsp;{AMBIENT,&nbsp;&nbsp;0.3,&nbsp;0.3,&nbsp;0.3,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LOCALVIEWER,&nbsp;1.0,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ATTENUATION,&nbsp;1.0,&nbsp;1.5,&nbsp;LMNULL};</PRE>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81848mhay"></A>The fixed scene attenuation factor dampens
the overall attenuation function. By increasing the value of the fixed
attenuation factor, you lessen the effect of the distance-dependent attenuation.
It is a good idea to start off with the fixed attenuation factor equal
to 1.0. That way, when the distance from the vertex to the light is zero,
there is no attenuation. Furthermore, if you make the attenuation rate
factor large, the illumination falls off too quickly. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81869mhay"></A>There are two reasons why the formula
shown is used for attenuation, rather than some different form (for example,
an inverse square law): </P>


<UL><LI><A NAME="A155C1474"></A>One reason is based on physical principles.
Although it is true that light from a POINT source falls off as the square
of the distance, this is not true when one is near an extended light source.</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A34C011a6c"></A>The other reason that the inverse linear form
is preferred has to do with monitor phosphors and the dynamic range of
typical monitors. No monitor can be as bright as the sun, nor as dark as
a cave. Their dynamic range does not approach the capabilities of the human
eye. An inverse square attenuation (or an exponential attenuation) leads
to very large changes in brightness. Such attenuations normally result
in a very poor visual appearance on the monitor.</LI></UL>
