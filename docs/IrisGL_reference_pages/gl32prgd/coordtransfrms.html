<H2><A NAME="coordtransfrms.html"></A>Coordinate Transformations </H2>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2475mhay"></A>When displaying 3-D shapes, it is useful
to be able to move the shapes around relative to each other and to the
viewer; to rotate and scale them; and to be able to change the viewer's
point of view, field of view, and orientation. The subroutines that perform
coordinate transformations allow you to manipulate geometric figures and
viewpoints in 3-D space in very general ways. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2495mhay"></A>GL converts the 3-D coordinates of geometric
figures into pixels on the screen in the following operations: </P>


<OL><LI><A NAME="A264X9138"></A>A set of 3-D operations, such as rotation,
translation, and scaling moves the objects and viewpoint to the desired
position for a given scene.</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A264X9139"></A>A subsequent operation maps 3-D points to 2-D
screen coordinates, taking into consideration the portion of 3-D space
(as well as its orientation with respect to the screen) that is visible
during a given scene.</LI></OL>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2519mhay"></A>The 3-D operations can be further divided
into projection, viewing, and modeling transformations. Conversion from
the original 3-D figures to the 2-D pixels on the screen is handled by
another set of subroutines, including the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/viewport.html#qrY270marj">viewport</A></B>
and <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lsetdepth.html#naR120marj">lsetdepth</A></B>
subroutines. </P>


<H3><A NAME="A264X913c"></A>Types of Coordinate Systems </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2540mhay"></A>There are basically five coordinate systems
of interest. First, there is a 3-D system defined in right-handed Cartesian
floating-point coordinates; vertices are specified in (<I>x</I>,<I>y,z</I>)
triplets. Let us refer to this as the modeling coordinate system. There
are no limits to the size of sensible coordinates (other than the largest
legal floating-point value). </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2561mhay"></A>The second system is the world coordinate
system, also a 3-D floating-point coordinate system. World coordinates
are used conceptually for locating the entire scene. For example, the drawing
of a bolt may be defined at the origin of the modeling coordinate system
(because this is the easiest way to define a bolt), but that bolt may be
drawn repetitively in many different places in world coordinates. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2582mhay"></A>The third is called the eye, or viewer,
coordinate system. The position of all things is measured with respect
to the location of the viewer's eye. GL uses the same set of subroutines
to manipulate the placement of shapes in these first three coordinate systems.
These subroutines become the modeling, viewing, and projection transformations,
depending on the order in which they are called and the mode the system
is in. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2603mhay"></A>The fourth is called the normalized coordinate
system. This system is also 3-D with floating-point values, but its range
is limited to -1.0 &amp;le; <I>x</I>,<I>y</I>,<I>z </I>&amp;le; 1.0. The
3-D cube defined by these limits is convenient for clipping. After transformation
to the normalized system, the clipping hardware eliminates all geometry
with coordinates outside the range of -1.0 to 1.0. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2624mhay"></A>The <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> coordinates
of this 3-D cube are scaled directly into the fifth coordinate system,
usually called the screen coordinate system. If you draw into an arbitrarily
placed window on the screen, the pixel at the lower-left corner of the
window has screen coordinates (0,0). Because screen coordinates represent
pixel values, they are always expressed in integers, so the transformation
from normalized coordinates to screen coordinates might involve some rounding
and consequent loss of accuracy. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2644mhay"></A>Screen coordinates are typically thought
of as 2-D, but in fact all three dimensions of the normalized coordinates
are scaled, and there is a screen <I>z</I> coordinate that can be used
for many things, such as hidden surface removal and depth-cueing. </P>


<H3><A NAME="A30C010fc0"></A>Types of Transformations </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2666mhay"></A>This section contains information on:</P>

Transformations</A></LI>


<LI><A NAME="A96C16"></A><A HREF="coordtransfrms.html#A264X9141">Projection
Transformations</A></LI></UL>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2689mhay"></A>To map between the five coordinate systems,
there are four distinct types of coordinate transformations. These are
as follows: </P>


<UL><LI><A NAME="A30C010fc2"></A><A HREF="coordtransfrms.html#A264X916c">Modeling
transformations</A>, which map from modeling coordinates to world coordinates.
That is, they take a 3-D figure drawn in modeling coordinates and indicate
how it is placed in world coordinates.</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A30C010fc3"></A><A HREF="coordtransfrms.html#A264X915f">Viewing
transformations</A>, which map from world coordinates to eye coordinates.
That is, they indicate the location of the eye and the direction in which
it is looking, and relate that to world coordinates.</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A30C010fc4"></A><A HREF="coordtransfrms.html#A264X9141">Projection
transformations</A>, which map from eye coordinates to normalized device
coordinates. Projection transformations are usually used to control the
amount of perspective in the scene.</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A30C010fc5"></A>Viewport transformations, which map from normalized
device coordinates (NDC) to device coordinates (DC) (also called screen
coordinates or window-relative coordinates). These control the placement
of the drawn scene on the monitor; that is, where it appears on the screen.
Viewport transformations are not full-fledged transformations like the
previous three; for example, rotations are not allowed. These transformations
are controlled by the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/viewport.html#qrY270marj">viewport</A></B>
and <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lsetdepth.html#naR120marj">lsetdepth</A></B>
subroutines.</LI></UL>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2714mhay"></A>These transformations are represented
in the following <A HREF="figures/gl32p4.jpg">figure</A>. </P>


<H3><A NAME="A264X916c"></A>Modeling Transformations<A NAME="INDEX415"></A>
<A NAME="INDEX416"></A> <A NAME="INDEX417"></A> <A NAME="INDEX418"></A></H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2737mhay"></A>When you create a graphical object, or
geometric model, the system creates it with respect to its own coordinate
system. You can manipulate the entire object using the modeling transformation
subroutines: <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/rotate.html#A8g2120marj">rotate</A></B>,
<B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/rot.html#A144X9562">rot</A></B>,
<B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/translate.html#A144X95c8">translate</A></B>,
and <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/scale.html#A144X95a6">scale</A></B>.
By combining or linking together drawing subroutines, you can create more
complex modeling transformations that express relationships between different
parts of a complex object. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2757mhay"></A>All objects drawn after these subroutines
execute are transformed as specified by the individual subroutine. Therefore,
<A HREF="cntrltransfrms.html#cntrltransfrms.html">controlling the order</A> in which you
specify transformation operations is extremely important. </P>


<H4><A NAME="A264X9181"></A>rotate Subroutine </H4>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2780mhay"></A>The <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/rotate.html#A8g2120marj">rotate</A></B>
subroutine rotates graphical objects by specifying an angle and an axis
of rotation. The angle is given in tenths of degrees according to the right-hand
rule: if the right hand is wrapped around the axis of rotation, the fingers
curl in the same direction as positive rotation, and the thumb point in
the same direction as the axis of rotation. A right-handed rotation is
counterclockwise. An x, y, or z character defines the axis of rotation.
(The character can be uppercase or lowercase.) </P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><P><A NAME="A30C010fc6"></A><B>Note: </B>In the following discussion, the
word <I>object</I> refers to the general idea of a drawn thing or shape
(graphical primitive). It does not refer specifically to display lists.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2801mhay"></A>All objects drawn after the <B>rotate</B>
subroutine executes are rotated. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2821mhay"></A>The <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/rot.html#A144X9562">rot</A></B>
subroutine is similar to the <B>rotate</B> subroutine, except that the
angle is given in floating point. Both subroutines create a <A HREF="figures/gl32p82.jpg">matrix</A>
and premultiply it into the current matrix. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2842mhay"></A>The <B>rot</B> and <B>rotate</B> subroutines
syntax is as follows: </P>


<PRE><A NAME="A258C01c16e"></A>void&nbsp;rotate(Angle&nbsp;angle,&nbsp;Char8&nbsp;axis)</PRE>


<PRE><A NAME="A258C01c16f"></A>void&nbsp;rot(Float32&nbsp;angle,&nbsp;Char8&nbsp;axis)</PRE>


<H4><A NAME="A300X9c21"></A>translate Subroutine </H4>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2866mhay"></A>The <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/translate.html#A144X95c8">translate</A></B>
subroutine moves the object origin to the point specified in the current
object coordinate system. All objects drawn after the <B>translate</B>
subroutine executes are translated. The <B>translate</B> subroutine creates
a <A HREF="figures/gl32p83.jpg">matrix</A> and premultiplies it into the
current matrix. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2886mhay"></A>The syntax is as follows: </P>


<PRE><A NAME="A258C01c170"></A>void&nbsp;translate(Coord&nbsp;x,&nbsp;Coord&nbsp;y,&nbsp;Coord&nbsp;z)</PRE>


<H4><A NAME="A300X9c22"></A>scale Subroutine </H4>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2909mhay"></A>The <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/scale.html#A144X95a6">scale</A></B>
subroutine shrinks, expands, and mirrors objects. Its three parameters
(<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>z</I>) specify scaling in each of the three coordinate
directions. Values with magnitudes greater than 1 expand the object; values
with magnitudes less than 1 shrink it. Negative values cause mirroring.</P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2929mhay"></A>All objects that are drawn after the <B>scale</B>
subroutine executes are scaled. The <B>scale</B> subroutine creates a <A HREF="figures/gl32p84.jpg">matrix</A>
and premultiplies it into the current matrix. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2949mhay"></A>The syntax is as follows: </P>


<PRE><A NAME="A258C01c171"></A>void&nbsp;scale(Float32&nbsp;x,&nbsp;Float32&nbsp;y,&nbsp;Float32&nbsp;z)</PRE>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2970mhay"></A>The modeling subroutines are illustrated
in the following <A HREF="figures/gl32p5.jpg">figure</A>. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A2992mhay"></A>The modeling subroutines are not commutative:
if you reverse the order of operations, you can get different results.
The following <A HREF="figures/gl32p6.jpg">figure</A> shows (a) a rotation
of 60 degrees about the origin followed by a translation of 4 degrees in
the X direction. Part (b) shows the same operation performed in the reverse
order. Rotations are about the origin of the coordinate system. </P>


<H3><A NAME="A264X915f"></A>Viewing Transformations<A NAME="INDEX419"></A>
<A NAME="INDEX420"></A> <A NAME="INDEX421"></A> <A NAME="INDEX422"></A></H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3015mhay"></A>The viewing transformations allow you
to specify the position of the eye in the world coordinate system, and
to specify the direction toward which it is looking. The <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/polarview.html#A144X94fc">polarview</A></B>
and <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lookat.html#A144X9452">lookat</A></B>
subroutines provide convenient ways to do this. </P>


<H4><A NAME="A300X9c1d"></A>polarview Subroutine </H4>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3037mhay"></A>The <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/polarview.html#A144X94fc">polarview</A></B>
subroutine assumes that the object you are viewing is near the origin.
The eye's position is specified by a radius (distance from the origin)
and by angles measuring the azimuth and elevation. The specification is
similar to polar coordinates, hence, the name. There is still one degree
of freedom because these values tell only where the eye is relative to
the object. A <I>twist</I> parameter tells which direction is up. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3058mhay"></A>The angle of incidence equals the angle
between the Z-axis in world coordinates and the location of the origin
of viewing coordinates. The angle of azimuth equals the angle between the
X-axis in world coordinates and the <I>x</I>,<I>y</I> coordinates of the
origin of the viewing coordinates. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3079mhay"></A>To understand incidence and azimuth, imagine
that you are standing at the origin in world coordinates. You are facing
north, along the Y-axis, with the X-axis on your right. The Z-axis points
straight up, towards the zenith. There is a very large eye in the sky,
looking down at you. It is located at the origin of the viewing coordinate
system. This eye is the system, and whatever that eye sees appears on the
screen. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3100mhay"></A>Where is the eye? The azimuth is the compass
point at which it is located: 0 degrees if straight north, 90 degrees if
straight east, and so on, in a clockwise fashion (in conformance with astronomical
usage). The incidence is the angle down from zenith: 0 degrees means the
eye is directly overhead; 90 degrees means that the eye is on the horizon.</P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3120mhay"></A>The altitude (again following astronomical
usage) is precisely equal to 90 degrees minus the incidence. This coordinate
system is called <I>horizon coordinates</I> or <I>topocentric coordinates</I>.
The syntax is as follows: </P>


<PRE><A NAME="A258C01c172"></A>void&nbsp;polarview(Coord&nbsp;distance,&nbsp;Angle&nbsp;azimuth,&nbsp;Angle&nbsp;incidence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angle&nbsp;twist)</PRE>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3141mhay"></A>The following <A HREF="figures/gl32p7.jpg">figure</A>
illustrates this viewpoint concept. </P>


<H4><A NAME="A300X9c1e"></A>lookat Subroutine </H4>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3164mhay"></A>The <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lookat.html#A144X9452">lookat</A></B>
subroutine allows you to specify the eye's position in space and a point
at which it is looking. Both points are given with Cartesian <I>x</I>,
<I>y</I>, and <I>z</I> coordinates. A <I>twist</I> parameter specifies
the angle of rotation. Once you specify the eye position, the point you
are looking at could be any point along a line, and the identical transformation
is specified. This viewpoint concept is illustrated in the following <A HREF="figures/gl32p8.jpg">figure</A>.</P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3186mhay"></A>Both viewing subroutines work in conjunction
with a projection subroutine. If you wish to view point (1, 2, 3) from
point (4, 5, 6) in perspective, use the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/perspective.html#A144X94da">perspective</A></B>
and <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lookat.html#A144X9452">lookat</A></B>
subroutines in conjunction. When the orthogonal projections are used, the
exact position of the eye used in the viewing subroutines does not make
any difference. The only thing that matters is the viewing direction. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3206mhay"></A>The viewing transformations work mathematically
by transforming, by means of rotations and translations, the position of
the eye to the origin and by adjusting the viewing direction so that it
lies along the negative Z axis. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3226mhay"></A>The <B>polarview</B> and <B>lookat</B>
subroutines create a <A HREF="figures/gl32p85.jpg">matrix</A> and premultiply
it into the current matrix. </P>


<H3><A NAME="A264X9141"></A>Projection Transformations<A NAME="INDEX423"></A>
<A NAME="INDEX424"></A> <A NAME="INDEX425"></A> <A NAME="INDEX426"></A></H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3248mhay"></A>Viewing items in perspective on the computer
screen is like looking at them through a rectangular piece of perfectly
transparent glass. Imagine drawing a line from your eye through the glass
to an item. The line colors a dot on the glass the same color as the spot
on the item intersected by that line. If this were done for all possible
lines through the glass, if the coloring were perfect, and the eye not
allowed to move, then the picture painted on the glass would be indistinguishable
from the true scene. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3268mhay"></A>The collection of all the lines leaving
your eye and passing through the glass would form an infinite four-sided
pyramid with its apex at your eye. Anything outside the pyramid would not
appear on the glass, so the four planes passing through your eye and the
edges of the glass would clip out invisible items. These are called the
<I>left</I>, <I>right</I>, <I>bottom</I>, and <I>top</I> clipping planes.</P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3289mhay"></A>The geometry hardware also provides two
other clipping planes that eliminate anything too far from the eye or too
near the eye. They are called the <I>near</I> and <I>far</I> clipping planes.
Near and far clipping is always turned on, but it is possible to set the
near plane very close to the eye and the far plane very far from the eye
so that all the geometric items of interest are visible. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3309mhay"></A>Because floating-point calculations are
not exact, it is a good idea to move the near plane as far as possible
from the eye, and to bring in the far plane as close as possible. This
gives optimal resolution for distance-based operations such as those discussed
in <A HREF="remhidden.html#remhidden.html">&quot;Removing Hidden Surfaces&quot;</A>
 and <A HREF="depth-cueing.html">&quot;Performing Depth-Cueing&quot;</A>.</P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3329mhay"></A>Thus, for a perspective view, the region
that is visible looks like an Egyptian pyramid with the top sliced off.
The technical name for this is a frustum, or rectangular viewing frustum.</P>


<H4><A NAME="A300X9c1a"></A>perspective Subroutine </H4>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3351mhay"></A>The <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/perspective.html#A144X94da">perspective</A></B>
subroutine maps a frustum of eye, or viewer, space so that it exactly fills
the viewport. This frustum is part of a pyramid whose apex is at the origin
(0.0, 0.0, 0.0), whose base is parallel to the X<I>-</I>Y plane, and which
extends along the negative Z axis. In other words, it is the view obtained
when the eye at the origin looks down the negative Z axis, and the plate
of glass is perpendicular to the line of sight, as shown in the <A HREF="figures/gl32p9.jpg">figure</A>.</P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3372mhay"></A>The <B>perspective</B> subroutine has
four parameters: the field of view in the y direction, the aspect ratio,
and the distances to the near and far clipping planes. Typically, the aspect
ratio is chosen so that it is the same as the aspect ratio of the window
on the screen, but it need not be. The distances to the near and far clipping
planes are floating-point values. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3393mhay"></A>Mathematically, the <B>perspective</B>
subroutine works by mapping the 3-D volume enclosed by the viewing frustum
into normalized device coordinates. Any point outside the frustum is mapped
to a point outside the cube; that is, at least one of its coordinates is
greater than 1.0 or less than -1.0. The clipping hardware then eliminates
all the geometry outside the normalized viewing cube, and the <I>x</I>
and <I>y</I> coordinates of the remaining geometry are scaled linearly
to fill the window on the screen. The syntax is as follows: </P>


<PRE><A NAME="A258C01c173"></A>void&nbsp;perspective(Angle&nbsp;fovy,&nbsp;Float32&nbsp;aspect,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coord&nbsp;near,&nbsp;Coord&nbsp;far)</PRE>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3415mhay"></A>All the projection transformations work
basically the same way. A viewing volume is mapped into the normalized
cube, the geometry outside the cube is clipped out, and the remaining data
is linearly scaled to fill the window (actually the viewport). The only
differences between the projection transformations are the definitions
of the viewing volumes. </P>


<H4><A NAME="A300X9c1b"></A>window Subroutine </H4>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3436mhay"></A>Another perspective projection transformation
is the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/window.html#A144X95ea">window</A></B>
subroutine. This subroutine is similar to the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/perspective.html#A144X94da">perspective</A></B>
subroutine, but its viewing frustum is defined in terms of distances to
the left, right, bottom, top, near, and far clipping planes. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3457mhay"></A>The <B>window</B> subroutine specifies
the position and size of the rectangular viewing frustum closest to the
eye (in the near clipping plane) and the location of the far clipping plane.
The following <A HREF="figures/gl32p10.jpg">figure</A> illustrates this
function, defining a viewing window in the X-Y plane looking down the negative
Z axis. A perspective view of the image is projected onto the window. The
syntax is as follows: </P>


<PRE><A NAME="A258C01c174"></A>void&nbsp;window(Coord&nbsp;left,&nbsp;Coord&nbsp;right,&nbsp;Coord&nbsp;bottom,&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coord&nbsp;top,&nbsp;Coord&nbsp;near,&nbsp;Coord&nbsp;far)



</PRE>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3479mhay"></A>The perspective transformation subroutines
create <A HREF="figures/gl32p86.jpg">matrices</A> and load them as the
projection matrix. </P>


<H4><A NAME="A300X9c1c"></A>ortho and ortho2 Subroutines </H4>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3500mhay"></A>The other two projection subroutines that
are part of GL are the orthogonal transformations. Their viewing volumes
are rectangular boxes. They correspond to the limiting case of a perspective
frustum as the eye is moved infinitely far away and the field of view decreases
appropriately. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3521mhay"></A>Another way to think of the <B>ortho</B>
subroutines is that the geometry outside the box is clipped out, and the
geometry inside is projected parallel to the Z axis onto a face parallel
to the X-Y plane. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3541mhay"></A>The <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/ortho.html#A144X9496">ortho</A></B>
subroutine allows you to specify the entire box: the X, Y, and Z limits.
The <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/ortho.html#A144X9496">ortho2</A></B>
subroutine, usually used for 2-D drawing, requires a specification of the
X and Y limits only. The Z limits are assumed to be -1 and 1. Objects with
<I>z</I> coordinates outside the range -1.0 &amp;le; z &amp;le; 1.0 are
clipped out. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3561mhay"></A>The following <A HREF="figures/gl32p11.jpg">figure</A>
illustrates this function, defining a viewing window in the X-Y plane looking
down the negative Z axis. An orthographic view of the object between the
near and far planes is projected onto the window. The syntax is as follows:</P>


<PRE><A NAME="A258C01c175"></A>void&nbsp;ortho(Coord&nbsp;left,&nbsp;Coord&nbsp;right,&nbsp;Coord&nbsp;bottom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coord&nbsp;top,&nbsp;Coord&nbsp;near,&nbsp;Coord&nbsp;far)</PRE>


<P><A NAME="A3C0E9A3584mhay"></A>The orthographic subroutines create <A HREF="figures/gl32p87.jpg">matrices</A>
and load them as the projection matrix. </P>
