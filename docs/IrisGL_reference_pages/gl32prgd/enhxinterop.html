<P><A NAME="A3C0F00B255mhay"></A>This section describes the interoperability
between GL applications and Enhanced X-Windows and discussing interoperability
issues such as queue handling and synchronization. The interoperability
topics discussed in this section are as follows: </P>

<H3><A NAME="f2ASg12fcsol"></A>Mapping and Unmapping GL Windows </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F00B381mhay"></A>The mapping of GL windows can be deferred
by creating them using a <B>noport</B>; <B>winopen</B>; subroutine combination.
The <B>mapwin.c</B> example program illustrates this usage. However, the
following warning applies: </P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><P><A NAME="A71A2E3533csol"></A><B>Attention: </B>One should NEVER draw
into a recently mapped window until after a REDRAW (MapNotify) event has
been received for that window. For a window to be ready for GL rendering,
it must not only be mapped, but the X server must complete a number of
internal computations. After the X server has properly set up the window,
it will generate a REDRAW (MapNotify) event for that window. Any drawing
done prior to the receipt of the REDRAW event will result in a race condition:
drawing orders may be lost or ignored, or other unrelated unpredictable
behaviors may result (such as the inconsistent placement of the mapped
window). Invoking XSync is NOT sufficient to guarantee that the X server
has completed mapping the window. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>


<H3><A NAME="iO8Sg147csol"></A>Integration of GL and Enhanced X-Windows</H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F00B442mhay"></A>By default, there is no guaranteed synchronization
between actions performed through the Enhanced X-Windows programming interface
(hereafter termed X) and the GL programming interface. In particular, there
is no guarantee that drawing done with X and drawing done with GL will
appear on the screen in the same order as performed by the application.</P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F00B512mhay"></A>The underlying reason for this asynchronous
behavior is the differing GL and X drawing models. The X server does all
X drawing, and much of the rest of X processing. The processing does not
actually occur until the X server is scheduled to run by the operating
system; in the meantime, work requests are queued up. In contrast, all
GL drawing subroutines send drawing orders to the graphics adapter directly;
the adapter, in turn, renders as fast as possible. </P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><P><A NAME="A71A2E6426csol"></A><B>Note: </B>For some harware systems,
there is no synchronization of drawing across GL windows resulting in asynchronous
windows input. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F00B564mhay"></A>Synchronization of X and GL drawing can
be re-established by using the <B>finish</B> subroutine and the <B>XSync</B>
subroutine. The <B>finish</B> subroutine will block (will not return) until
all GL primitives have been rendered. The <B>XSync</B> subroutine flush
the X display connection. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F00B604mhay"></A>Use of the <B>XSync</B> subroutine does
not guarantee that all X drawing is complete; it only guarantees that the
Windows Server has received all generated Windows protocol packets. The
Windows Server and/or adapter can still be in the process of rendering
when the <B>XSync</B> subroutine returns. Since the latency between the
Windows Server's receipt of a protocol packet and the completion of rendering
to the screen is almost never more than a few milliseconds, this latency
should normally not be noticeable. </P>


<H3><A NAME="ee8Sg148csol"></A>Maintaining Synchronization </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F00B736mhay"></A>On the POWER Gt4 and the POWER Gt4x adapters,
there is no guarantee that drawing is synchronized between different windows
belonging to the same process. That is, a line drawn in one window may
appear on the screen before a polygon is drawn in another window, even
though the application made the subroutine call to draw the polygon before
the subroutine call to draw the line. This de-synchronization occurs because
a separate FIFO (first-in, first-out queue) is maintained for every window.
All drawing commands are placed as tokens into the FIFOs. The graphics
hardware has been designed to service the FIFOs in a round-robin fashion;
the hardware does not necessarily drain one FIFO before moving on to the
next. As a result, tokens in one FIFO may be processed before tokens in
another, even though they were placed in the FIFO at a later time. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F00B777mhay"></A>In most cases, the synchronization jitter
should be on the order of milliseconds, or less, and should therefore be
visually unobservable. If it is absolutely vital to re-establish synchronization,
the <B>finish</B> subroutine can be used. The<B> finish </B>subroutine
blocks (does not return to the calling application) until all buffers/FIFOs
associated with the current window have been drained. The <B>finish</B>
subroutine guarantees, in effect, that all drawing sent to a window has
appeared on the screen. </P>


<H3><A NAME="A6C855E724vbia"></A>X11 Header File Collision with the /user/include/gl/gl.h
File </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F00B832mhay"></A>The <B>/user/include/gl/gl.h</B> file
contains three typedefs that collide with X11 Toolkit Header files. These
typedefs are as follows: </P>


<UL><LI><A NAME="A6C855F067vbia"></A>typedef long Boolean;</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A6C855F218vbia"></A>typedef long Object;</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A6C855F369vbia"></A>typedef char *String;</LI></UL>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F00B878mhay"></A>To avoid this collision, adhere to following
directions: </P>


<UL><LI><A NAME="A6C855F700vbia"></A>Do not use these GL types in any source
file that includes X11 code.</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A6C855F866vbia"></A>Include all X11 header files before including
any GL header file.</LI></UL>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F00B930mhay"></A>By doing this, the X11 types will hold,
and the GL types will be undefined. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F00B970mhay"></A>These three typedefs were in the <B>/usr/include/gai/g3dm2types.h</B>
file and have been moved to the <B>/usr/include/gl/gl.h</B> file. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F00C010mhay"></A>The typedefs Boolean and String were colliding
with similiar typedefs in the <B>/usr/include/X11/Intrinsic.h</B> file
while Object collided with a structure definition in the <B>/usr/include/X11/Object.h</B>
file. The following was placed in <B>/usr/include/gl/gl.h</B> file to alleviate
the type collisions. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F00C048mhay"></A>#ifndef _XtIntrinsic_h </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F00C158mhay"></A>typedef long Boolean; </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F00C206mhay"></A>typedef char *String; </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F00C230mhay"></A>#endif </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F00C292mhay"></A>#ifndef _XtObject_h </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F00C351mhay"></A>typedef long Object; </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F00C391mhay"></A>#endif </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F00C514mhay"></A>This scenario requires that any include
of XToolkit header files must occur before any include of <B>/usr/include/gl/gl.h</B>
file. While using mixed mode programming the X11 types are the only valid
types. </P>
