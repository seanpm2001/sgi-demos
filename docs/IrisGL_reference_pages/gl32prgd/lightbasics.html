<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80377mhay"></A>This section discusses the basic techniques
of lighting, including: </P>


<UL><LI><A NAME="A258C01bfbe"></A>A Simple <A HREF="lightbasics.html#A342C970d0">Lighting
Calculation</A></LI>

<H3><A NAME="A342C970d0"></A>A Simple Lighting Calculation </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80402mhay"></A>The <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/cylinder1_c.html#Ggi2e0marj">cylinder1.c</A></B>
example program (found in Symbol.&amp;TRGraphics;) illustrates how to use
GL to light a cylinder using a simple lighting calculation. Consider a
pale gray cylinder with a rough surface that is illuminated by a source
of white light. Objects with rough surfaces tend to reflect or scatter
light equally in all directions. Such reflections are termed diffuse reflections.</P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80422mhay"></A>In our simple lighting calculation, the
color and intensity of the diffusely reflected light at a point on the
surface depends on three things: </P>


<UL><LI><A NAME="A342C970d3"></A>Light source color</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A342C970d4"></A>The angular relationship between the light
source direction and reflecting surface orientation at that point</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A342C970d5"></A>The reflectance characteristics of the cylinder
surface</LI></UL>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80445mhay"></A>The short arrows in the following <A HREF="figures/gl32p23.jpg">figure</A>
show how the diffuse light is scattered equally in all directions. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80467mhay"></A>The orientation of the reflecting surface
is specified by the surface normal vector, which is perpendicular to the
surface at the point in question. The normal vector must be normalized
(must be of unit length). Because the surface normal differs at every point
on a curved surface, the calculation for reflected light produces a different
color at every point on the surface. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80488mhay"></A>The number of points used in the lighting
calculations depends on the number of vertices used to define the surface.
For a local light (a light not very far from the surface), the system computes
a color at every vertex of the polygon mesh used to represent the surface.
The application writer must specify the surface-normal vector at every
vertex of the polygon mesh. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80509mhay"></A>In addition to the light originating from
the light source that reflects off the surface, ambient light is also accounted for in the model. Ambient light is assumed
to be nondirectional and is reflected uniformly in all directions by the
reflecting surface. Thus, the color and intensity of the reflected ambient
light are functions of both the level of ambient light in the scene and
the reflectance properties of the surface. They are not functions of the
angular relationship between the source of light and the surface normal.</P>


<H4><A NAME="A258C01bfc2"></A>Subroutines from Example Program cylinder1.c</H4>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80531mhay"></A>The example C language program <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/cylinder1_c.html#Ggi2e0marj">cylinder1.c</A></B>
introduces four new subroutines that use the GL lighting facility. The
new subroutines are <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/mmode.html#XhZ2370marj">mmode</A></B>,
<B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmdef.html#rgZ2250marj">lmdef</A></B>,
<B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmbind.html#XeZ2340marj">lmbind</A></B>,
and <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/n3f.html#A139X91ef3">n3f</A></B>.</P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80552mhay"></A>To perform lighting calculations, the
system must be able to distinguish between the projection matrix (used
by the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/perspective.html#A144X94da">perspective</A></B>
subroutine) and the viewing and modeling matrix (used by the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lookat.html#A144X9452">lookat</A></B>
subroutine and the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/rotate.html#A8g2120marj">rotate</A></B>
subroutine). The <B>mmode</B> subroutine is used to indicate to the hardware
which matrices represent <A HREF="specialterms.html#A27P021">projection transformations</A>
and which represent <A HREF="specialterms.html#A27P021">viewing</A> or <A HREF="specialterms.html#A27P021">modeling
transformation</A>s. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80573mhay"></A>The <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmdef.html#rgZ2250marj">lmdef</A></B>
subroutine, called from the <TT><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/cylinder1_c.html#A64EA57551ttay">def_simple_light_calc</A></TT> subroutine of the example program, found
in  in<I> GL3.2 Version 4 for AIX: Graphics Library (GL) Technical Reference</I>, defines instances of the three necessary components
to perform a lighting calculation: </P>


<UL><LI><A NAME="A342C970dc"></A>A surface material</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A342C970dd"></A>A light source</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A342C970de"></A>A lighting model</LI></UL>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80597mhay"></A>The program line <TT>lmdef(DEFMATERIAL,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;NULL)</TT>
tells GL about surface material number 1. The value given the first parameter,
<TT>DEFMATERIAL</TT>, indicates that you are defining a surface material.
The value for the second parameter defines this material as material number
<TT>1</TT>. The value for the third parameter (<TT>0</TT>) is the length
of the properties array specified by the fourth parameter. The properties
array specifies the properties of the surface material. Here, NULL instructs
GL to use the default values for surface materials. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80619mhay"></A>The next two calls to the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmdef.html#rgZ2250marj">lmdef</A></B>
subroutine are similar to the first. By substituting <TT>DEFMATERIAL</TT>
with <TT>DEFLIGHT,</TT> and subsequently <TT>DEFLMODEL</TT>, you can define
a light source and lighting model using the default values prescribed by
GL. The default values for a surface material, a light source, and a lighting
model are all that are necessary to perform a simple lighting calculation.
Properties of a lighting model are the properties that affect the entire
scene rather than a specific light source or surface material (the intensity
and color of the ambient light in the scene). The subroutine <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmdef.html#rgZ2250marj">lmdef</A></B>
is covered in greater detail in the section on <A HREF="lightsubs.html#lightsubs.html">lighting
subroutines</A>. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80641mhay"></A>Another subroutine introduced in the example
program is the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmbind.html#XeZ2340marj">lmbind</A></B>
subroutine. Once you have defined a surface material, light source, and
lighting model you can instruct GL to use them when performing lighting
calculations. The three calls to the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmbind.html#XeZ2340marj">lmbind</A></B>
subroutine in the example program tell the system to use the material,
light source, and light model defined by the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmdef.html#rgZ2250marj">lmdef</A></B>
subroutine. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80663mhay"></A>It is more efficient to define surface
materials, light sources, and lighting models before activating them with
the <B>lmbind</B> subroutine because more computation is involved in defining
models than in invoking them. By predefining all the materials, light sources,
and lighting models to use in your application, you can quickly switch
among different materials and lighting sources when drawing a scene. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80684mhay"></A>There can be only one active light model
and surface material at any one time. However, you can use up to the value
of MAXLIGHTS lights, where MAXLIGHTS is a constant defined in the <B>/usr/include/gl/gl.h</B>
file. (The value is 8 for the High Performance 3-D Color Graphics Processor,
and should not be changed.) The example program <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/cylinder2_c.html#A16C0c87c">cylinder2.c</A></B>
(found in  in<I> GL3.2 Version 4 for AIX: Graphics Library (GL) Technical Reference</I>) uses multiple lights. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80706mhay"></A>The final new subroutine is the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/n3f.html#A139X91ef3">n3f</A></B>
subroutine. Use it to define surface normal vectors. Look at the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/n3f.html#A139X91ef3">n3f</A></B>
subroutine called from the 
<TT><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/cylinder1_c.html#A64EA59429ttay">draw_cylinder</A></TT> subroutine of the example program (found
in  in<I> GL3.2 Version 4 for AIX: Graphics Library (GL) Technical Reference</I>) . In the simple lighting calculation, the resultant
color at a vertex depends on the angular relationship between the surface
normal at that vertex and the light source direction. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80728mhay"></A>The call to the <B>n3f</B> subroutine
sends a normal vector of unit length to the graphics hardware to be transformed
and subsequently used for a lighting calculation. Each time a different
normal is sent to the graphics hardware, a lighting calculation is performed
and the resultant color is associated with the vertex (using the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/v.html#A144X97a4">v3f</A></B>
subroutine) following the <B>n3f</B> command. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80749mhay"></A>If you have not done so already, try running
the example program <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/cylinder1_c.html#Ggi2e0marj">cylinder1.c</A></B>.
Notice as the cylinder rotates, the color changes to different shades of
gray. This is because the angular relationships between the surface normals
and the light source (which happens to be located behind our eye along
the <I>z</I> axis) is changing. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80771mhay"></A>Also, note that as the interior of the
cylinder comes into view, the interior color appears a constant shade of
dark gray. This is because the surface normals are facing away from the
light source, so the interior of the cylinder is illuminated only by ambient
light, which is independent of the direction of the light source. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80792mhay"></A>Now that you have seen how to implement
a simple lighting calculation, you can expand the capabilities of the lighting
calculation to include specularity and multiple surface materials and lights.</P>


<H3><A NAME="A342C970eb"></A>Specularity<A NAME="INDEX502"></A> <A NAME="INDEX503"></A>
<A NAME="INDEX504"></A> <A NAME="INDEX505"></A> </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80814mhay"></A>What if the cylinder in the example were
made of a shiny metal instead of a rough material? Compared to rough or
diffusely reflecting surfaces that reflect light equally in all directions,
smooth surfaces tend to reflect light in a directional manner. This directional
reflection, called specular reflection, is what causes highlights. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80836mhay"></A>On a perfectly smooth surface such as
a mirror, the direction of a reflected ray is equal to the angle of incidence
(that is, the angle between the light direction vector and the surface
normal vector). On surfaces that are less than perfectly smooth there will
be some scattering of the reflected light. Thus, the angle of the reflected
light is weighted towards, but not always equal to, the angle of incidence
(see the following <A HREF="figures/gl32p24.jpg">figure</A>). </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80858mhay"></A>Calculations for diffusely reflected light
from a light source depend on the angular relationship between the surface
normal and light source direction, as well as the reflectance characteristics
of the surface. In addition to reflectance characteristics, specularly
reflected light depends on the angular relationships between the surface
normal, light source direction, and view direction. When the view direction
coincides with the direction of the reflected light rays, the viewer sees
a specular highlight or glare. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80880mhay"></A>The surface material of the cylinder can
be made to appear smoother by incorporating specular reflections. You can
do this by changing the <TT><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/cylinder1_c.html#A64EA57551ttay">def_simple_light_calc</A></TT> subroutine to look like this: </P>


<PRE><A NAME="A342C970f2"></A>def_simple_light_model(){</PRE>


<PRE><A NAME="A342C970f4"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lmdef(DEFMATERIAL,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;11,&nbsp;shiny_material);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lmdef(DEFLIGHT,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;NULL);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lmdef(DEFLMODEL,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;NULL);
}</PRE>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80904mhay"></A>At the module level of the program, include
the definition for the <TT>shiny_material</TT> property array: </P>


<PRE><A NAME="A342C970f9"></A>float&nbsp;&nbsp;shiny_material[]&nbsp;=&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPECULAR,&nbsp;0.8,&nbsp;0.8,&nbsp;0.8,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIFFUSE,&nbsp;0.4,&nbsp;0.4,&nbsp;0.4,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHININESS,&nbsp;30.0,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LMNULL};</PRE>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80926mhay"></A>Now we have provided a non-<TT>NULL</TT>
properties array; values are available for further lighting calculations.
Properties are set by specifying a property identifier followed by the
expected values for that property. In our example, we set the specular
reflectance (using <TT>SPECULAR</TT> as the property identifier) of the
surface for the red, green, and blue components of white light to <TT>[0.8</TT>,
<TT>0.8</TT>, and <TT>0.8],</TT> respectively. Likewise, the diffuse reflectance
was set to <TT>[0.4</TT>, <TT>0.4</TT>, <TT>0.4]</TT>. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80948mhay"></A>Reflectance components vary between 0.0
and 1.0 (0.0 being 0% reflective and 1.0 being 100% reflective). The shininess
property indicates how smooth or shiny the surface appears. The higher
the number, the smoother the surface, and subsequently the more focused
the specular highlight. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80969mhay"></A>The values for <TT>SHININESS</TT> can
range from <TT>0.0</TT> (no specular highlight) to <TT>128.0</TT> (very
focused specular highlight). The shininess specified should be a whole
number. When a property identifier and the corresponding values are specified
in a call to the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmdef.html#rgZ2250marj">lmdef</A></B>
subroutine, the new value for that property overrides a default that is
provided by GL. This way, you have to specify only those properties whose
default values you do not want. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA80991mhay"></A>You must always end a property list with
the <TT>LMNULL</TT> token. This token lets GL know that you are finished
specifying properties. There are more properties for surface materials
that we have not discussed as well as other properties that apply specifically
to lighting models and light sources. A complete description of all the
properties available to the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmdef.html#rgZ2250marj">lmdef</A></B>
subroutine call and their defaults appears in the section on <A HREF="lightsubs.html#lightsubs.html">Lighting
Subroutines</A> . </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81012mhay"></A>If you run the example program with these
changes, you will notice how much shinier the cylinder looks. Watch how
the highlight appears when the surface normals point at your eye and disappear
as they move away. </P>


<H3><A NAME="A342C97101"></A>Multiple Surface Materials and Multiple Lights<A NAME="INDEX506"></A>

<A NAME="INDEX516"></A> <A NAME="INDEX517"></A> </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81035mhay"></A>The next example program displays two
intersecting cylinders, using a different surface material for each cylinder.
You can also light each cylinder with two light sources. Study the example
program <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/cylinder2_c.html#A16C0c87c">cylinder2.c</A></B>
(found in  in<I> GL3.2 Version 4 for AIX: Graphics Library (GL) Technical Reference</I>) . </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81057mhay"></A>At the top of the program, a second property
list is defined for a new material called <TT>purple_material</TT> and
a property list for a second light called <TT>blue_light</TT>. In the <TT>blue_light</TT>
property list, the light direction is specified as <TT>[0.0,&nbsp;1.0,&nbsp;0.0,&nbsp;0.0</TT>].
The first three numbers specify the <I>xyz</I> direction of the light.
The direction vector <TT>[0.0,&nbsp;1.0,&nbsp;0.0]</TT> indicates that
the light direction is along the <I>y</I> axis pointing towards the origin.</P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81079mhay"></A>In other words, the blue light is above
the cylinders and pointing toward them. The fourth number (<TT>0.0</TT>)
indicates that the light is positioned infinitely far away along the direction
vector (in our example the <I>y</I> axis). Differences between infinite
and noninfinite lights are discussed in <A HREF="advlightcap.html#advlightcap.html">&quot;Advanced
Lighting Capabilities&quot;</A>. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81101mhay"></A>The <TT>LCOLOR</TT> specifies the RGB
color of the light. This light has only blue color. By varying the values
of each of the three color components between 0.0 and 1.0 you can vary
the intensity of the light. That is, setting the blue light color to <TT>[0.0,&nbsp;0.0,&nbsp;0.6]</TT>
produces a more intense blue than it would have been if you had set the
color to <TT>[0.0,&nbsp;0.0,&nbsp;0.3</TT>]. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81123mhay"></A>In the <TT><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/cylinder2_c.html#A64EA47488ttay">def_light_calc</A></TT> subroutine, additional material and light
source are defined using the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmdef.html#rgZ2250marj">lmdef</A></B>
subroutine. In the <TT><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/cylinder2_c.html#A64EA47742ttay">use_light_calc</A></TT> portion of the program, both light sources
are bound because both are used during the entire animation. However, because
you want to switch back and forth between surface materials, the program
does not bind the surface material until ready to use it. In the main loop,
the program performs an </P>


<PRE><A NAME="A342C971d0"></A>lmbind(MATERIAL,&nbsp;1)</PRE>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81145mhay"></A>before drawing the first cylinder and
then another </P>


<PRE><A NAME="A342C971d2"></A>lmbind(MATERIAL,&nbsp;2)</PRE>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81167mhay"></A>when drawing the second cylinder. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EA81188mhay"></A>When you run the example program <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/cylinder2_c.html#A16C0c87c">cylinder2.c</A></B>,
notice that the first cylinder has the same surface material as the cylinder
drawn by the example program <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/cylinder1_c.html#Ggi2e0marj">cylinder1.c</A></B>,
but that the second cylinder consists of a duller, purple material. In
addition, each cylinder reflects different amounts of the blue overhead
light. </P>
