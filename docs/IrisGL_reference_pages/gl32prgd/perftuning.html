<H2><A NAME="perftuning.html"></A>Performance Tuning </H2>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F02D958mhay"></A>Programming in GL is similar to programming
in a low-level language; small investments in programming effort can lead
to large performance gains. Furthermore, different machines and adapters
execute drawing commands at different relative drawing rates. An understanding
of the type of hardware your code runs on can help you get optimal performance.</P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F02D978mhay"></A>For example, there are many ways to draw
a rectangle: </P>


<UL><LI><A NAME="A78C1444"></A>Call the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/scrmask.html#fwN250marj">scrmask</A></B>
subroutine to mask off the appropriate area of the window, and then call
the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/clear.html#cEH1160marj">clear</A></B>
subroutine.</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A258C01c06d"></A>Call the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/czclear.html#A143X92c8">czclear</A></B>
subroutine.</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A258C01c06e"></A>Call the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/sboxf.html#Jte1190marj">sboxf</A></B>
subroutine.</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A258C01c06f"></A>Load the appropriate transform matrices on
the matrix stack, and then call the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/rectf.html#Q5g330marj">rectf</A></B>
subroutine.</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A258C01c070"></A>Call the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/rectwrite.html#A142X9c9e">rectwrite</A></B>
subroutine to block transfer of a pixmap that is one solid color. </LI></UL>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F02E003mhay"></A>Which of these methods draws the rectangle
most quickly depends on the type of hardware on which the code is executing.
The end goal also determines the choice of subroutines. If you want to
clear the entire window and its z-buffer, the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/czclear.html#A143X92c8">czclear</A></B>
subroutine is the fastest method of achieving this. But if you want to
clear only a portion of the window, the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/sboxf.html#Jte1190marj">sboxf</A></B>
subroutine executes faster than a combination of the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/scrmask.html#fwN250marj">scrmask</A></B>
and <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/clear.html#cEH1160marj">clear</A></B>
subroutines. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F02E022mhay"></A>The previous discussion is only an example.
There are several ways to perform nearly any graphics operation. Where
speed is critical, so is design. The following paragraphs discuss some
of the performance implications of new or modified subroutines. </P>


<TABLE><TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD NOWRAP="NOWRAP"><A NAME="A258C01c073"></A><B>lmcolor</B> subroutine </TD>


<TD>If the design calls for changing material properties often, consider
the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmcolor.html#ofZ220marj">lmcolor</A></B>
subroutine. By using the <B>lmcolor</B> subroutine, you can avoid using
the relatively slowly executing combination of the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmdef.html#rgZ2250marj">lmdef</A></B>
and <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/lmbind.html#XeZ2340marj">lmbind</A></B>
subroutines. If the <B>lmcolor</B> subroutine cannot be used, then perform
all transactions with the <B>lmdef</B> subroutine before drawing. This
method pulls the relatively slowly executing <B>lmdef</B> subroutine out
of the performance-critical drawing loop.</TD></TR>


<TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD NOWRAP="NOWRAP"><A NAME="A258C01c075"></A><B>curson, cursoff</B> subroutines</TD>


<TD>In the current release of GL, the <!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/curson.html#ru1280nita"><B>curson</B>
and <B>cursoff</B></A> subroutines turn the cursor visibility on and off.
However, they execute fairly slowly and should not be heavily used. 
<P><A NAME="A54C0149af"></A>GL formerly required the cursor to be turned
off before any drawing was done, and turned on again after drawing completion.
This is no longer required. However, existing code that is being ported
to the current release may often make use of this function. This code should
be modified to remove these subroutines, or the subroutines should be effectively
removed by using the <B>#ifdef</B> condition with the C programming language
preprocessor. Not doing so can result in a severe performance impact will
be observed. </P></TD></TR>


<TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD NOWRAP="NOWRAP"><A NAME="A258C01c076"></A><B>mapcolors, getmcolors</B> subroutines</TD>


<TD>If the design employs color maps or color map mode, use the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/mapcolors.html#cv2170marj">mapcolors</A></B>
and <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/getmcolors.html#UI2f0marj">getmcolors</A></B>
subroutines. Using these subroutines improves performance 10 to 1,000 times
over using the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/mapcolor.html#A146X9535">mapcolor</A></B>
or <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/getmcolor.html#nXI1100marj">getmcolor</A></B>
subroutines inside a drawing loop. 
<P><A NAME="A258C01c078"></A>Color maps are managed by the X server. The
server updates the color map as change requests come into it. The <B>mapcolor</B>
and <B>mapcolors</B> subroutines make one change request to the X server
every time they are called. Because there is considerable system overhead
in communication with the X server process, change requests are processed
most efficiently if they are buffered and sent as one request by using
the <B>mapcolors</B> subroutine. </P>



<TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD NOWRAP="NOWRAP"><A NAME="A110C11e"></A><B>concave</B> subroutine </TD>


<TD>The <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/concave.html#HXf320marj">concave</A></B>
subroutine causes the system to use more robust, but slower algorithms
to render concave polygons correctly. If all affected polygons are convex,
the applications programmer should disable the concavity check; this causes
the system to use faster algorithms for polygon rendering. On most adapters,
the performance improvement gained by disabling concave polygon-checking
should be noticeable.</TD></TR>


<TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD NOWRAP="NOWRAP" COLSPAN="2"><A NAME="A110C120"></A><B>getcolor, getcpos, getgpos,
getmatrix, gRGBcolor</B> subroutines </TD></TR>


<TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>


<TD>These routines must query the graphics adapter to obtain the information
that they return. Due to the current graphics adapter design, there is
a significant amount of latency in such an operation. For the returned
data to be valid, the graphics adapter must complete all preceding operations
that may be queued for execution. In some cases, the queue may be quite
deep, or some operations may take a long time. Therefore, the amount of
time it takes any of these five routines to execute is variable, and could
be quite long, depending on the contents of the queue. To obtain maximum
performance, the use of these routines should be avoided.</TD></TR>


<TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD NOWRAP="NOWRAP"><A NAME="A110C122"></A><B>scale</B> subroutine </TD>


<TD>If lighting is enabled, and the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/scale.html#A144X95a6">scale</A></B>
subroutine is called with unequal arguments, the system is forced to renormalize
all normal vectors. On some adapters, there is a noticeable performance
improvement if the <B>scale</B> subroutine is not used with unequal arguments.</TD></TR>

</TD></TR></TABLE>


<H3><A NAME="A48E4C6448vbia"></A>Writing Event Driven Applications </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F02E055mhay"></A>Most graphics applications are event driven.
When developing such applications, keep in mind that the responsiveness
is highly dependent on the rate of arrival of events. In particular, the
mouse transmit rate can have a tremendous impact on <I>look and feel</I>
performance (that is, how the system appears to respond to a mouse movement).</P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F02E075mhay"></A>The reason for this is easy to understand.
Many applications try to perform some fixed (and possibly large) amount
of processing per mouse event. For example, the update and redraw of a
slider, a scrollbar, or a 3D viewing parameter. High mouse transmit rates
cause a large number of events to be queued up, and an application that
does not discard some fraction of these events appears to be slow and sluggish.
In contrast, low mouse transmit rates cause the same application to appear
light and responsive. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F02E097mhay"></A>Following are several remedies you can
use to improve user-interface response. </P>


<UL><LI><A NAME="A48E4C7475vbia"></A>Decrease the mouse transmit rate. This
is the most obvious approach. The program found in the <B>/usr/lpp/GL/examples/chrate.c</B>
file shows how to use the terminal device driver to control the rate at
which the mouse reports changes in its position. 

<BLOCKQUOTE><A NAME="BC736F2066vbia"></A><B>Note: </B>Currently, there is no interface
in GL, nor in AIXwindows, that controls this transmit rate.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P><A NAME="A48AA46814vbia"></A>This remedy is acceptable for prototype
and non-commercial code. However, if the application is meant to be marketed
to a broad customer base, it is not wise to depend strongly on the mouse
transmit rate. Setting the mouse transmit rate may adversely affect other
applications; and conversely, if other applications set the mouse transmit
rate, your application may be adversely affected. </P></LI>


<LI><A NAME="A48AA47218vbia"></A>Decrease the amount of work done per event.
One way to do this is to simply record the current mouse position whenever
a MOUSEX or MOUSEY event arrives, but not perform any other work. When
the event queue has finally been emptied, then the image (whatever is being
drawn) can be updated based on the last recorded position. Thus, events
are processed very quickly, but significant computation is not performed
until events have stopped arriving.</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A48AA47642vbia"></A>Discard every other, or even two out of
every three, mouse events. This strategy is less desirable than the others
because it can give an inferior look and feel. This strategy can be particularly
troublesome when the user is attempting to position some object very carefully
with the mouse. A small correction made by the user may be the event that
is thrown away.</LI></UL>


<H3><A NAME="A48E4C8440vbia"></A>Minimizing REDRAW Events </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F02E127mhay"></A>You can reduce the number of REDRAW events
issued to a GL application by changing the window manager default for feedback
boxes. To do this, add the following to the <B>$HOME/.Xdefaults</B> file:</P>


<PRE><A NAME="A48AA48461vbia"></A>Mwm*showFeedback:restart</PRE>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F02E150mhay"></A>This setting causes the window manager
not to display the small window size and position indicator that is normally
shown when you move or resize a window. When it is on, this small indicator
box (located in the center of the screen) can land on a GL window and generate
REDRAW events. Multiple REDRAW events can result in significant performance
impact on applications which take a long time to regenerate a window. </P>


<H3><A NAME="A48E4C9206vbia"></A>Fast Line Drawing </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F02E171mhay"></A>You can improve polyline drawing performance
by using the <B>polylinelist</B> subroutine. The <B>polylinelist</B> subroutine
helps eliminate the subroutine interface calling overhead of the <TT>bgnline
... v ... v ... endline</TT> interface. Subroutine calling overhead into
the GL library can exceed one microsecond per call. </P>


<H3><A NAME="A48E4C9597vbia"></A>Fast Pixel Transfer (BLITS) </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F02E192mhay"></A>On the POWER Gt4 and POWER Gt4x
adapters, and on the POWER Gt4, POWER Gt4x, and
POWER GXT1000 adapters, the use of the <B>rectread</B> and <B>rectwrite</B>subroutines is deprecated. The <B>lrectread</B> and <B>lrectwrite</B>
subroutines provide a faster, more efficient interface to pixel transfers.
The format of the pixels can be adjusted with the pixmode subroutine. </P>
