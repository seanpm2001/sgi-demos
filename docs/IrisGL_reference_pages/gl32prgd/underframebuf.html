<H2><A NAME="underframebuf.html"></A>Understanding the Frame Buffer </H2>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EB46065mhay"></A>Effective use of the full capabilities
of GL requires an understanding of the frame buffer and its organization.
GL supports overlay planes, underlay planes, a double-buffered &quot;main&quot;
frame buffer, a z-buffer, an alpha buffer, color maps, and gamma ramps
(see the figure entitled <A HREF="figures/gl32p1.jpg">Frame Buffer Configuration</A>).
These can be turned on or off, reconfigured, masked with writemasks, and
so on. However, the actual number of bitplanes in each buffer varies from
adapter to adapter, and therefore the ways in which these bitplanes can
be configured and controlled vary from adapter to adapter. The following
sections present some basic concepts about the operation of a frame buffer.
Following these brief discussions are descriptions of the characteristics
of the different systems. </P>


<H3><A NAME="A78C13c4"></A>Main Color Buffer </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EB46089mhay"></A>The main color buffer can be thought of
as having the width and height of the window and a depth that can vary
from 8 bits to 48 bits, depending on the current configuration and the
installed adapter. Pixels stored in this main buffer can be interpreted
through a downstream color map (that is, the values stored in the frame
buffer are color map indexes), or they can be interpreted directly as red,
green, blue (RGB) values, with no intervening color maps. (For more information
on how to use or bypass the color maps, see &quot;<A HREF="workcolor.html#workcolor.html">Working
in Color Map and RGB Modes</A>&quot;.) </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EB46112mhay"></A>The main color buffer can be single buffered
or double buffered, depending on the current configuration and the installed
adapter. In double buffer mode, the main color buffer is divided in two:
the front buffer, which is visible, and the back buffer, which is invisible
but can be drawn into. Double buffering is an important technique used
to provide smooth animation of moving pictures. (For more information on
how to use double buffering, see &quot;<A HREF="animatescene.html#animatescene.html">Creating
Animated Scenes</A>&quot;.) </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EB46134mhay"></A>The color map configuration and single
and double buffer configuration can be changed dynamically by making appropriate
GL subroutine calls. The scope of such reconfiguration extends only over
the current drawing window. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EB46157mhay"></A>Multiple windows can appear on the screen,
each independently double buffered, each in color map or RGB mode independent
of the others. There is no limit to the number of such windows. </P>


<H3><A NAME="A78C13c9"></A>Overlay and Underlay Buffers </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EB46179mhay"></A>Like the main color buffer, the overlay
and underlay buffers have the width and height of the window. Their depth
can range from 0 to 4 bits deep, depending on the installed adapter and
the current configuration. Overlay and underlay bitplanes cannot be double
buffered and are always in color map mode. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EB46201mhay"></A>Overlays and underlays function exactly
as the names suggest: drawing into the overlay buffer obscures the main
color buffer, and drawing into the main color buffer obscures the underlay.
(For more information on overlays and underlays, consult &quot;<A HREF="underovermodes.html#underovermodes.html">Underlay
and Overlay</A> Modes&quot;.) </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EB46223mhay"></A>Some sophisticated applications find that
four overlay and four underlay planes are not enough. Multiple overlays
or underlays, even double-buffered overlays and underlays, can be created
by appropriately manipulating the color map and the writemasks associated
with the main color buffer. Such tricks can easily get quite complicated,
and such extra overlays have effectively been stolen from the main color
buffer. (For more information on writemasks, see &quot;<A HREF="writemasks.html#writemasks.html">Writemasks
and Logical Operations</A>&quot;.)</P>


<H3><A NAME="A78C13cd"></A>Alpha Buffer </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EB46246mhay"></A>In order for GL to support an alpha blending
(transparency) buffer, the installed adapter must contain an alpha buffer.
(For more information on alpha blending, see &quot;<A HREF="alphablend.html#alphablend.html">Alpha
Blending Modes</A> &quot;.) </P>


<H3><A NAME="xCk2270nita"></A>Z-Buffer<A NAME="INDEX592"></A> <A NAME="INDEX593"></A>
<A NAME="INDEX594"></A> <A NAME="INDEX595"></A> </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EB46269mhay"></A>The z-buffer stores the <I>z</I> value
for each pixel on the screen. The <I>z</I> value represents the <I>z</I>
coordinate, or distance to the eye, for each pixel. When z-buffering is
enabled with the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/zbuffer.html#A143X97b1">zbuffer</A></B>
subroutine, the system compares the <I>z</I> values for each pixel of any
new polygon, line, point, or character to the current <I>z</I> value for
each pixel and renders only those values representing a distance closer
to the eye. (For further discussion of z-buffering, see &quot;<A HREF="remhidden.html#remhidden.html">Removing
Hidden Surfaces</A>&quot;.) </P>


<H3><A NAME="RGk2f0nita"></A>Query Functions </H3>


<P><A NAME="A3C0EB46292mhay"></A>The query functions available for determining
the current frame buffer configuration are the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/getdrawmode.html#A143X9482">getdrawmode</A></B>,
<B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/getplanes.html#A143X94a4">getplanes</A></B>,
and <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../gl32tref/getzbuffer.html#A9SR350marj">getzbuffer</A></B>
subroutines. </P>
