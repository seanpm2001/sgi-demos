<H1><A NAME="specialterms.html"></A>Special Terms Used in GL </H1>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A3015mhay"></A><B>ambient light. </B>Light that reflects
off of one or more surfaces in the scene before arriving at the target
surface. Ambient light is assumed to be non-directional, and is reflected
uniformly in all directions by the reflecting surface. In the GL, ambient
light is mocked up by use of ambient terms in the lighting equation, rather
than actually computing the reflections. </P>


<P><A NAME="A78P0547"></A><B>aspect ratio</B>. The ratio of the
height of a primitive to its width. A rectangle of width ten inches and
height five inches has an <B>aspect ratio</B> of 10/5 or 2. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A3040mhay"></A><B>asynchronous</B>. Not synchronized
in time. For example, input events occur at the choosing of the user--the
program may read them later. </P>


<P><A NAME="A78P0561"></A><B>attribute</B>. A parameter that can
affect the appearance of a drawing primitive. For instance, color is an
attribute. If the color is set to &quot;RED&quot;, it will remain red until
changed, and everything that is drawn will be drawn in red. Other attributes
include linestyle, linewidth, pattern, and font. For a list of attributes
and pipeline options, see the <B><!--:libs:gl32tref:--><A HREF="../../libs/gl32tref/greset.html#xW42e0nita">greset</A></B>
subroutine. See also <I><A HREF="#A3C0F2A4046mhay">pipeline options</A></I><B>.</B></P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A3065mhay"></A><B>azimuthal angle</B>. If a primitive
is sitting on the ground, with its <I>z</I> coordinate straight up, the
azimuthal viewing angle is the angle the observer makes with the <I>y</I>
axis in the <I>x</I>-<I>y</I> plane. If the observer walks in a circle
with the primitive at the center, the azimuthal angle is the only thing
that varies. </P>


<P><A NAME="A150P1959"></A><B>B-spline cubic curve</B>. A cubic spline
approximation to a set of four control points having the property that
slope and curvature are continuous across sets of control points. See also
<I><A HREF="#A3C0F2A3949mhay">parametric cubic curve</A></I>. </P>


<P><A NAME="A25P03bd"></A><B>backfacing polygon</B>. A polygon whose
vertices appear in clockwise order in screen space. If backface culling
is enabled, such polygons are not drawn. </P>


<P><A NAME="A25P03be"></A><B>basis</B>. In the GL, a curve or patch
basis is a 4x4 matrix that controls the relationship between control points
and the approximating spline. B-splines, Bezier curves, and Cardinal splines
all differ in that they have different bases. </P>


<P><A NAME="A25P03bf"></A><B>Bezier cubic curve</B>. A cubic spline
approximation to a set of four control points that passes through the first
and fourth control points, and has a continuous slope where two spline
segments meet. See also <I><A HREF="#A3C0F2A3949mhay">parametric cubic
curve</A></I>. </P>
 

<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A3129mhay"></A><B>bitplane</B>. A <B>bitplane </B>supplies
one bit of color information per pixel on the display. Thus, an eight bitplane
system allows 2 to the eighth power different colors to be displayed at
each pixel. </P>


<P><A NAME="A60P0184"></A><B>blit</B>. Bit block transfer. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A3152mhay"></A><B>Boolean</B>. A value of TRUE or FALSE,
where TRUE=1 AND FALSE=0 </P>


<P><A NAME="A255B966"></A><B>bounding box</B>. A rectangle (2D)
that bounds a primitive. A bounding box can be used to determine whether
the primitive lies inside a clipping region. See 
<I><A HREF="#A25P03e0">clipping.</A></I></P>


<P><A NAME="A1819349"></A><B>button</B>. Buttons include those on
the keyboard, mouse, light pen, or buttons on the dial and button box.</P>


<P><A NAME="A25P03de"></A><B>Cardinal cubic spline curve</B>. A
cubic spline whose endpoints are the second and third of four control points.
A series of cardinal splines will have a continuous slope, and will pass
through all but the first and last control points. See also <I><A HREF="#A3C0F2A3949mhay">parametric
cubic curve</A></I>. </P>


<P><A NAME="A25P03e0"></A><B>clipping</B>. If a primitive overlaps
the boundaries of a window, it is <I>clipped</I>. The part of a primitive
that appears in the window is displayed and the rest is ignored. There
are several types of clipping that occur in the system. Three-D drawing
primitives are clipped to the boundaries of a frustum (for perspective
transformations) or to a rhombohedron (for orthographic projections). This
3-D clipping applies as well to the origin of character strings, but not
to the characters themselves. A 2-D clipping is also performed, where all
drawing is clipped to the boundaries of AIXwindows. The area
of 2-D clipping can be controlled with the screenmask. See <I>clipping
planes</I>, <I><A HREF="#A26P0519">fine clipping</A></I>, 
<I><A HREF="#A26P0613">gross
clipping</A></I>, <I><A HREF="#A27P018">screenmask</A></I>, 
<I><A HREF="#A27P021">transformation</A></I>,
<I><A HREF="#A13791dc4">window</A></I>. </P>


<P><A NAME="A25P03e1"></A><B>clipping planes</B>. Before clipping
occurs, primitive space is mapped to normalized device coordinates. The
clipping planes <I>x</I>= +-<I>w</I>; <I>y</I>= +-<I>w</I>; or
<I>z</I>= +-<I>w</I> correspond to the left, right, top, bottom, near,
and far planes bounding the viewing frustum. See 
<A HREF="#A26P051d">frustum</A>.</P>


<P><A NAME="A31996bc"></A><B>color map</B>. A lookup table that
translates color indexes into RGB triplets. The lookup table is sandwiched
between the frame buffer and the digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and
serves to translate the color index value stored in the frame buffer into
the red, green, and blue values required by the DACs. On most hardware
configurations, the color map is either 8 or 12 bits deep, allowing the
simultaneous display of 256 or 4096 colors. On most hardware configurations,
the DACs have an 8-bit per color accuracy, allowing the user to choose
among 16,777,216 colors. </P>


<P><A NAME="A25P03e3"></A><B>color map mode</B>. A configuration
of the hardware that passes the values stored in the frame buffer through
a color lookup table (color map), from which the red, green, and blue values
are obtained for display. Entries in the color map are referred to as color
indexes. In color map mode, the values stored in the frame buffer are treated
as color map indexes. See <I><A HREF="#A26P0743">RGB mode</A></I>.</P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A3251mhay"></A><B>color ramp.</B> A progression of colors
in a color map. Most color ramps are smooth, and have only a small number,
if any, of discontinuities. For instance, if the full set of colors of
the rainbow were loaded into the color map, that would constitute a color
ramp. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A3263mhay"></A><B>concatenation</B>. In the GL, concatenation
refers to combining a series of geometric transformations--rotations, translations,
and scaling. Concatenation of transformations corresponds to matrix multiplication.</P>


<P><A NAME="A60P0188"></A><B>concave and convex polygons. </B>A
polygon is convex if the line segment joining any two points in the figure
is completely contained within the figure. Non-convex polygons are sometimes
called concave. Algorithms that render only convex polygons are much simpler
than those that can render both convex and concave polygons. </P>


<P><A NAME="A25P03e7"></A><B>control points</B>. Points in real
space that control the shape of a spline curve. The system provides hardware
support for wire frame rational cubic splines, and for NURBS surfaces,
the specifications of which require four control points. </P>


<P><A NAME="A25P03e8"></A><B>culling</B>. If a primitive is smaller
than the minimum size specified in the command, it is <I>culled</I>: no
further commands in the primitive are interpreted. See <I><A HREF="#A25P03e0">clipping</A></I>,
<I><A HREF="#A26P0706">pruning</A></I>. </P>


<P><A NAME="A25P03e9"></A><B>current character position</B>. The
two-dimensional screen coordinates where the next character string or pixel
read/write will occur. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A3323mhay"></A><B>current color</B>. The color that is
employed to color all subsequent drawing primitives. All drawing primitives
are drawn with this color until it is changed. </P>


<P><A NAME="A25P03eb"></A><B>current graphics position</B>. The
homogeneous three-dimensional point form which geometric drawing commands
will draw. The current graphics position is not necessarily visible. </P>




<P><A NAME="A25P03ed"></A><B>current transformation matrix</B>.
The transformation matrix on top of the matrix stack. All points passed
through the graphics pipeline are multiplied by the current transformation
matrix before being passed on. The current transformation matrix is a concatenation
of the current modeling and viewing matrices. See <I><A HREF="#A27P021">transformation</A></I>.</P>


<P><A NAME="A60P0189"></A><B>current window</B>. The window to which
the system directs the output from graphics routines. See also <I><A HREF="#A13791dc4">window</A></I>.</P>


<P><A NAME="A263A93ae"></A><B>cursor</B>. A primitive such as an
arrowhead which can be moved about the screen by means of an input device
(typically a mouse). </P>


<P><A NAME="A25P03ee"></A><B>cursor glyph</B>. A 16x16 or 32x32
raster pattern (bitmap that determines the shape of the cursor. A GL cursor
glyph can be one or two bits deep; thus, a GL cursor can use up to three
colors. Color 0 is always transparent. </P>


<P><A NAME="A150P19d9"></A><B>depth-cueing</B>. Varying the intensity
of a line with z-depth. Typically, the points on the line further from
the eye are darker, so the line seems to fade into the distance. </P>


<P><A NAME="A1379161d"></A><B>device</B>. A valuator, button, or
the keyboard. Buttons have values 0 or 1 (up or down); valuators (mouse,
dials) return values in a range, and the keyboard returns ASCII values.</P>


<P><A NAME="A26P0470"></A><B>dial and switch box</B>. An I/O device
with 8 dials (valuators) and 32 switches. The switch box is also called
a <I>button box</I> or the <I>lighted programmable function keys</I> (LPFKs).</P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A3431mhay"></A><B>digital-to-analog converter (DAC).</B>
A highly specialized chip that converts the digital values coming out of
the frame buffer into the rapidly varying analog voltage levels that are
required by the monitor. </P>


<P><A NAME="A26P0473"></A><B>display list (object)</B>. Also called
an object. It is a sequence of drawing commands that have been compiled
into a unit. Conceptually, a display list is like a macro: it can be invoked
multiple times simply by referring to its name. The object can be instantiated
at different locations, sizes, and orientations by appropriate use of the
transformation matrices. For instance, series of polygons arranged in the
shape of a bolt can be compiled into an object. The bolt can then be drawn
multiple times by invoking its display list. </P>


<P><A NAME="A137915eb"></A><B>dithering</B>. A technique of interleaving
dark and light pixels so that the resulting image looks smoothly shaded
when viewed from a distance. </P>


<P><A NAME="A26P0474"></A><B>double buffer mode</B>. A mode in which
two buffers are alternately displayed and updated. A new image can be drawn
into the back buffer while the front buffer (containing the previous image)
is displayed. See 
<I><A HREF="#A27P01c">single
buffer mode</A></I>.</P>


<P><A NAME="A26P0484"></A><B>event queue</B>. A queue that records
changes in input devices--buttons, valuators, and the keyboard. The event
queue provides a time-ordered list of input events. </P>


<P><A NAME="A237X9485e"></A><B>eye coordinates, eye space</B>. The
coordinate system in which the viewer's eye is located at the origin, and
thus all distances are measured with respect to the eye. Viewing transformations
map from world coordinates into eye coordinates, and projection transformations
map from eye coordinates to normalized device coordinates. Also called
viewing coordinates or viewer coordinates. See 
<I><A HREF="#A26P06el">modeling coordinates</A></I>,
<I><A HREF="#A27P03d">world coordinates</A></I>, 
<I><A HREF="#A27P017">screen coordinates</A></I>,
<I><A HREF="#A27P021">transformation</A></I>. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A3504mhay"></A><B>field of view</B>. The extent of the
area which is under view. The field of view is defined by the <B><A HREF="#A27P036">viewing
matrix</A></B>
in use. </P>


<P><A NAME="A26P0519"></A><B>fine clipping</B>. Fine clipping masks
all drawing commands to a rectangular region of the screen. It would be
unnecessary except for the case of character strings. The origin of a character
string after transformation may be clipped out by gross, or 3-D, clipping,
and the string would not be drawn. By doing gross clipping with the viewport
and fine clipping with the screen masks, strings can be moved smoothly
off the screen to the left or bottom. See <I><A HREF="#A26P0613">gross
clipping</A></I>.</P>


<P><A NAME="A270A983b"></A><B>font</B>. A set of characters in a
particular style. See <I><A HREF="#A26P073b">raster
font</A></I>,
<I><A HREF="#A237X9486c">primitive
font</A></I>.</P>


<P><A NAME="A26P051b"></A><B>forward difference matrix</B>. A 4x4
matrix that is iterated by adding each row to the next and the bottom row
is output as the next point. Points so generated generally fall on a rational
cubic curve. </P>


<P><A NAME="A270A984a"></A><B>frame buffer</B>. A quantity of video
RAM (VRAM) that is used to store the image displayed on the monitor. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A3565mhay"></A>The frame buffer is the electronic canvas
on which every drawing primitive is drawn. It is one of the last stops
in the graphics pipeline, where the final image resides in the form of
digitally coded intensities and brightnesses. These are converted into
analog voltage signals 60 times a second and sent to the electron guns
of the monitor. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A3578mhay"></A>The dimensions of the frame buffer can
be changed with GL. Typically, the main frame buffer might be 1024 pixels
vertical by 1280 pixels horizontal by 8 color bits. The overlay planes
might by 1024x1280x2. The z-buffer is considered a frame buffer, although
it is not directly visible from the monitor. (There is no direct means
of displaying the contents of the z-buffer, although this can be done indirectly.)
The size of the z-buffer is typically 1024x1280x24. The cursor is a very
specialized form of a frame buffer; one which can move around. The typical
cursor is 32x32x2 in size. </P>


<P><A NAME="A26P051c"></A><B>front and back buffers</B>. In double
buffer mode, the main frame buffer bitplanes are separated into two sets--the
front and back buffers. Bits in the front buffer planes are visible and
those in the back buffer are not. Typically, an application draws into
the back buffer and views the front buffer for dynamic graphics. </P>


<P><A NAME="A26P051d"></A><B>frustum</B>. A truncated, four-sided
pyramid; that is, a pyramid with the point cut off. In a perspective projection,
the shape of the clipping volume is a frustum. The bottom of the frustum
is referred to the far clipping plane, the top of the frustum is the near
clipping plane, and the sides are respectively the top, left, bottom, and
right clipping planes. In an orthographic projection, the clipping volume
is a parallelepiped. </P>


<P><A NAME="A26P060f"></A><B>gamma correction</B>. A logarithmic
assignment of intensities to lookup table entries for shading applications.
This is required since the human eye perceives intensities logarithmically
rather than linearly. </P>


<P><A NAME="A26P0610"></A><B>gamma ramp</B>. A set of three lookup
tables, one for each of the colors red, green, and blue, attached to the
electron guns of the monitor. Entries in the gamma lookup table can be
set to adjust for variations in the phosphor quality between different
brands of monitors. Usually, a logarithmic curve is loaded into the gamma
lookup tables. (See <I><A HREF="#A26P060f">gamma
correction</A></I>.)
The gamma lookup tables are not a subset of the color map tables, but a
separate entity. </P>


<P><A NAME="A26P0611"></A><B>Gouraud shading</B>. A method of shading
polygons smoothly based on the intensities at their vertices. The color
is uniformly interpolated along each edge, and then the edge values are
uniformly interpolated along each scan line. For realistic shading, colors
should be gamma corrected. </P>


<P><A NAME="A26P0612"></A><B>graphics pipeline</B>. The sequence
of steps that a graphics primitive goes through before it becomes visible
on the screen: </P>


<UL><LI><A NAME="A25C0f70b"></A>Transformation from model coordinates to <A HREF="#A92250jess">NDC</A>

<LI><A NAME="A25C0f710"></A>Display of frame buffer.</LI></UL>


<P><A NAME="A26P0613"></A><B>gross clipping</B>. Also known as 3-D
clipping this is the clipping that occurs in normalized device coordinates,
against the sides of the perspective frustum. All 3-D primitives undergo
this clipping; in particular, the origin of text strings (but not individual
letters) are clipped in this way. See <I><A HREF="#A25P03e1">clipping
planes</A></I>,
<I><A HREF="#A26P0519">fine clipping</A></I>. </P>


<P><A NAME="A26P061d"></A><B>hidden surface</B>. A surface of a
geometric primitive that is not visible because it is obscured by other
surfaces. See <I><A HREF="#A154P1160a">z-buffering</A></I>. </P>


<P><A NAME="A26P061e"></A><B>hit</B>. Also called <B>pick hit</B>
or <B>select hit.</B> A hit occurs whenever a drawing primitive draws within
the picking or selecting region. A hit is reported back to the user only
if the name stack has changed since the last hit. In other words, multiple
hits may occur although only one pick/select even is reported. See 
<I><A HREF="#A26P06e3">name stack</A></I>,
<I><A HREF="#A26P06fa">picking</A></I>, <I><A HREF="#A27P019">selecting</A></I>. </P>


<P><A NAME="A26P0623"></A><B>homogeneous coordinates</B>. A four-dimensional
method of representing three-dimensional space. A point (<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>,
<I>z</I>, <I>w</I>) in homogeneous coordinates is used to represent a point
(<I>X</I>, <I>Y</I>, <I>Z</I>) in three-dimensional space by taking <I>X</I>=<I>x</I>/<I>w</I>,
<I>Y</I>=<I>y</I>/<I>w</I>, <I>Z</I>=<I>z</I>/<I>w</I>. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A3720mhay"></A><B>immediate mode</B>. In this mode, graphics
commands are executed immediately rather than being compiled into a display
list. </P>


<P><A NAME="A237X94864"></A><B>instantiate</B>. To make an instance
of. To replicate. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A3744mhay"></A><B>linear interpolation</B>. A method
of approximating data values by assuming that they lie along a straight
line. Typically, the two end data points are known. For example, if A is
the value at a, and B is the value at b, and a&lt;t&lt;b, then the value
C at t is (from the two-point formula):
<IMG SRC="figures/gl32p28.jpg"></P>


<P><A NAME="A172P1436"></A><B>linestyle</B>. The pattern used to
draw a line. A linestyle might be solid or broken into a pattern of dashes.</P>


<P><A NAME="A172P1437"></A><B>linewidth</B>. The width of a line
in pixels. </P>


<P><A NAME="A26P06dd"></A><B>matrix stack</B>. A stack of matrices
with hardware and software support. The top matrix on the stack is the
current transformation matrix, and all points passed through the graphics
pipeline are multiplied by that matrix. It is a concatenation of the current
modeling and viewing transformations. See 
<I><A HREF="#A25P03ed">current
transformation matrix</A></I>.</P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A3792mhay"></A><B>mirroring</B>. The creation of a mirror
image of a primitive. </P>


<P><A NAME="A26P06el"></A><B>modeling coordinates, modeling space</B>.
The coordinate system in which all drawing primitives do their drawing.
The user can select the position and orientation of the modeling space
with regard to the world space by means of translations, rotations, scales,
or generalized transformations. The relation between modeling coordinates
and world coordinates is determined by the modeling matrix. Modeling coordinates
are a useful conceptual device when drawing complex or repetitive scenes.
For instance, a paper clip can be defined once in modeling coordinates,
and then drawn hundreds of times by moving the modeling coordinates around
in world space. See <I><A HREF="#A237X9485e">eye
coordinates</A></I>,
<I><A HREF="#A27P017">screen
coordinates</A></I>,
<I><A HREF="#A27P03d">world coordinates</A></I>, <I><A HREF="#A27P021">transformation</A></I>. </P>


<P><A NAME="A26P06e3"></A><B>name stack</B>. A stack of 16-bit integers,
controllable by the user, used to establish what drawing primitive caused
a pick or select event. The name stack is written into the pick/select
event buffer every time a pick or select event occurs. The entire event
buffer is returned to the user at the end of the pick/select episode. </P>


<P><A NAME="A92250jess"></A><B>normalized device coordinates (NDC)</B>.
Coordinates in the range from -1 to 1. All primitives that draw within
the unit cube are visible on the screen (unless masked by the screenmask).
See <I><A HREF="#A27P021">transformation</A></I>, <I><A HREF="#WFu110nita">unit
cube</A></I>.</P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A3841mhay"></A><B>NTSC</B>. A video display and timing
format that is the American broadcast standard. Most video tape recorders
record and play back NTSC signals. Specialized hardware is required to
convert from RGB monitor outputs to an NTSC signal. </P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A3852mhay"></A><B>null-terminated</B>. Having a zero
byte at the end. In the C language, character strings are stored this way
internally. </P>


<P><A NAME="A272X92203"></A><B>NURBS</B>. (Non-Uniform Rational B-spline).
A parametric surface that can be trimmed with non-uniform rational B-spline
curves and piecewise linear curves. </P>


<P><A NAME="A255B9bc"></A><B>object</B>. Also called a display list.
It is a sequence of drawing commands that have been compiled into a unit.
Conceptually, a display list is like a macro: it can be invoked multiple
times simply by referring to its name. The object can be <A HREF="#A237X94864">instantiated</A> at different locations, sizes, and orientations
by appropriate use of the transformation matrices. For instance, series
of polygons arranged in the shape of a bolt can be compiled into an object.
The bolt can then be drawn multiple times by invoking its display list.</P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A3889mhay"></A><B>object space</B>. The space in which
a graphics object is defined. A convenient point is chosen as the origin
and the object is defined relative to this point. When an object is rendered
by a call to the <B>callobj</B> subroutine, it is rendered in modeling
coordinates, and the object space becomes (for that moment) the same as
the modeling space. </P>


<P><A NAME="A237X9486d"></A><B>orthographic projection</B>. A representation
in which the lines of a projection are parallel. Orthographic projections
lack <I>perspective foreshortening</I> and its accompanying sense of depth
realism. Because they are simple to draw, orthographic projections are
often used by draftsmen. See <I><A HREF="#A237X9486f">perspective
projection</A></I>.</P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A3912mhay"></A><B>parametric bicubic surface. </B>A surface
defined by three equations. The <I>x</I> equation is:
 
<IMG SRC="figures/gl32p29.jpg"></P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A3925mhay"></A>The equations for <I>y</I> and <I>z</I>

<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A3937mhay"></A>The points on a bicubic patch are defined
by varying the parameters <I>u</I> and <I>v</I> from 0 to 1. If one parameter
is held constant and the other is varied from 0 to 1, the result is a cubic
curve. If <I>w</I>(<I>u</I>,<I>v</I>)=1 for all <I>u</I>,<I>v</I>, the
bicubic surface is called &quot;ordinary,&quot; but if <I>w</I>(<I>u</I>,<I>v</I>)
varies as a function of <I>u</I>,<I>v</I>, then the surface is called &quot;rational.&quot;

<P><A NAME="A237X9486f"></A><B>perspective projection</B>. Perspective
projection is a technique used to achieve realism when drawing primitives.
In a perspective projection, the lines of projection meet at the viewpoint;
thus the size of a primitive varies inversely with its distance from the
source projection. The farther a primitive or part of a primitive is from
the viewer, the smaller it will be drawn. This effect, known as <I>perspective
foreshortening</I>, is similar to the effect achieved by photography and
by the human visual system. See <I><A HREF="#A237X9486d">orthographic
projection</A></I>.

The coordinate system that defines the display screen. Distances are measured
in units of pixels, and the origin is in the lower left-hand corner. On
most systems the screen size is 1024 pixels high by 1280 pixels wide. The

<P><A NAME="A27P021"></A><B>transformation</B>. A four-by-four
matrix that helps determine the location where 3D drawing will occur, the
position of the viewpoint (the viewer's eye), and the amount of the scene
encompassed and visible. Transformations occur at four points within the
graphics pipeline: </P>


<UL><LI><A NAME="A27P022"></A>Modeling transformation, which maps modeling
coordinates into world coordinates. All drawing primitives specify positions
that are presumed to be positions in modeling coordinates. Modeling transformation
can be used to move the thing being drawn.</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A27P023"></A>Viewing transformation, which maps from world
coordinates to viewer coordinates. The origin of the viewer coordinate
system can be thought of as the location of the viewer's &quot;eye,&quot;
and viewing transformations can be used to move the eye around in world
coordinates.</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A27P024"></A>Projection transformation, which defines the
boundaries of the clipping region. A projection transformation maps viewer
coordinates to normalized device coordinates, and the clipping plane boundaries
are at <I>x</I> =  +-<I>w</I>, <I>y</I> =  +-<I>w</I>, <I>z</I>
=  +-<I>w</I>. Projection transformations are used to define what
region of the world is visible on the screen.</LI>


<LI><A NAME="A27P025"></A>Viewport, or NDC to DC transformation. The viewport
transformation is not a full-fledged four-by-four transformation matrix;
only three of the diagonal elements in the matrix can be changed. The viewport
determines the mapping from normalized device coordinates to screen (device)
coordinates. By default viewports are the same size as the window, although
this can be adjusted.</LI></UL>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A4430mhay"></A><B>translation</B>. The moving of a display

<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A4512mhay"></A><B>vertical retrace period</B>. The amount
of elapsed time between retraces of the screen. All video monitors use
an electron beam to sweep the phosphors at the face of the monitor. Because
the phosphors glow for only a brief period of time, the entire screen must
be reswept periodically by the electron beam. On most monitors, this is
done 30 times per second (30 Hz). Thus, the vertical retrace period is
1/30 second. </P>


<P><A NAME="A27P036"></A><B>viewing matrix</B>. A matrix used to
describe the location of the viewer (the virtual eye looking upon a scene)
in relation to the world. See <I><A HREF="#A27P021">transformation</A></I>, <I><A HREF="#A27P03d">world
coordinates</A></I>.</P>


<P><A NAME="A27P039"></A><B>viewport</B>. The mapping from normalized
device coordinates to device coordinates. The viewport maps the unit cube
<I>x</I>/<I>w</I> =  +-1, <I>y</I>/<I>w</I> =  +-1, <I>z</I>/<I>w</I>
=  +-1 to the screen space, as measured in pixels. The viewport is
the last transformation in the graphics pipeline. The viewport can be smaller
or larger than the window and smaller or larger than the screenmask, although
in most applications, it is the same size. </P>


<P><A NAME="A13791dc4"></A><B>window</B>. An AIXwindow. A rectangular
area of the screen that can be moved about or placed on top of or pulled
under other windows, or iconized by the user. All drawing inside the window
is done by the GL process that created that window, and is totally under
the control of that process. The drawing of the window borders, however,
together with the window placement/iconization, is under the control of
the window manager, for example, the AIXwindows window manager.</P>


<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A4560mhay"></A>For most simple GL programs, the viewport
and screenmask are set to the same size as the window. Do not confuse an
AIXwindow with the GL window subroutine, which defines a <A HREF="#A26P051d">frustum</A> in <A HREF="#A27P03d">world

<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A4572mhay"></A><B>wire frame</B>. A graphics surface-drawing
technique in which the edges and contours of a primitive are represented
by simple lines. </P>


<P><A NAME="A27P03d"></A><B>world coordinates, world space</B>.
The user-defined coordinate system in which an image is described. Modeling
commands are used to position primitives in world space. Viewing and projection
transformations define the mapping of the world space to screen space.

<P><A NAME="A3C0F2A4599mhay"></A><B>writemask</B>. A set of 8 or 12 bits
(depending on the frame buffer configuration), one bit for each bitplane
of the frame buffer. During any drawing operation, only those planes enabled
by a 1 (one) in the bit mask can be altered. Planes set to 0 (zero) are
marked read only. </P>


<P><A NAME="A154P1160a"></A><B>z-buffer, z-buffering</B>. Applies
both to the device and the techniques commonly used as an aid in removing
hidden lines and hidden surfaces. If z-buffering is enabled, each pixel
will store a depth value as well as a color value. In simple terms, the
depth can be thought of as the distance from the viewer's eye to the pixel.
Whenever a drawing routine tries to update a pixel, it will first check
the current pixel's &quot;depth&quot; or &quot;z-value&quot; and will only
update that pixel with new values if the new pixel is closer than the current
pixel. The region of memory that stores the z-values is also referred to
as the z-buffer. </P>


<P><A NAME="A27P040"></A><B>zoom factor</B>. A multiplier to determine
the amount of enlargement of a specified screen rectangle. The <I>x</I>
zoom factor determines the enlargement in the <I>x</I> direction; the <I>y</I>
zoom factor, in the <I>y </I>direction. </P>
